# Echoes of the Departed

**Team Members:** Maahi, Vedant and Anoushka

**Pitch:** A pixel art based narrative-exploration game where cleaning tombstones reveals the untold stories of the dead.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
* Clean graves to unlock visual memories of the deceased.
* Judge souls by honoring or condemning their graves.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player cleans headstones, polish graves, and ensure that the dead of the graveyard are resting peacefully under their care. Each time they clean a grave, they gain a window into the life of the one buried beneathâ€”witnessing their joys, their struggles, and their final moments.

**30-Minute Engagement Plan & Scope:**
A number of unique graves to be cleaned by the player, each telling diverse 5-minute stories (a mix of genres such as war, mystery, romance, horror).
