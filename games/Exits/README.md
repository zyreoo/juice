## Game Pitch

**Source of inspiration: Based on DOORS, but with added (new unique elements, such as more complex puzzles, character skills, plot progression, etc.)**

**Players will enter an endless mysterious building, and may face different crises every time they open the door. As they delve deeper, they must solve puzzles, evade monsters, and work with teammates to find a way to escape.**

## Key Mechanics

- **Random room generation:** **Each time you play, the order and content of the rooms will be different, improving replayability.**
- **Enemies and Survival Mechanics:** **There are various types of monsters, each with unique behavior patterns (such as hiding type, chasing type, psychological oppression type).**
- **Multiplayer cooperation and strategy:** **Players can choose to disperse the exploration or act as a team, each method has different risks and rewards.**
- **Dynamic puzzles and exploration elements:** You need to unlock doors, decipher symbols, and find key items to move forward. Each game has a different combination of puzzles, preventing players from memorizing fixed solutions.

## Core Game Loop

1. Enter the room, explore the environment, and find clues and items.
2. **Solve the puzzle or choose to open the door to move forward.**
3. **Randomly trigger monster events, run away or hide.**
4. **Explore further or choose a different route.**
5. **Reach the final stage, find the exit or have different endings.**

## Player Engagement

- **High replayability: Random rooms, enemy behaviors, and different endings make players want to try again and again.**
- **Challenge and achievement system: specific survival conditions, speed clearance, etc. to motivate players.**
- **Social interaction: Multiplayer mode brings teamwork and strategy experience.**
- Immersive design: sound effects, lighting changes, and psychological oppression create a terrifying atmosphere.
