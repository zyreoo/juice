### How would you pitch your game in one line?

"It's like Temple Run meets Mad Max, but with a high-speed, physics-based motorcycle survival challenge in a chaotic arena of relentless traffic! But heres the trick the whole arena is made by a series of functions"

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?

**1.  High-Speed Dodging Madness**You’re on a motorcycle, trapped in an arena where cars come at you from every direction. Your job? Stay alive.

**2. Risk vs. Reward Stunts** Want to impress? Pull off near-miss dodges for bonus points. Get too cocky? Well... prepare to be roadkill.

**3. Arena Creation** The main arena will be seen one the user is done writing 4 or more function, and each fuction will creat a part of this arena. 

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Drop Into the Arena: You’re launched into the neon-lit battleground with one goal—DODGE EVERYTHING.

2. Build Your Own Mayhem: Here’s the kicker: You get to create the arena yourself. Using a series of functions (yes, math can be fun), you’ll design the battlefield.
  Want a roadblock? Boom, function. Want a truck that appears out of nowhere to ruin your day? Done. Every time you play, the arena looks completely different—because you’re the one causing the chaos!.

3.Upgrade everything (or Just Make It Cooler): Earn coins in mini-games and use them to level up your arena. Add defenses, upgrade your resources, or buy a snazzy new motorcycle to make your ride more epic.
The only limit? Your ability to survive in the arena long enough to get the coins.

### How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
1. Competing with Yourself (and Friends): Players are encouraged to come back for the thrill of improvement.Can you dodge even faster next time? Can you make it a full 10 minutes without getting smashed?
And when you’re done, show your friends how much you’ve crushed them on the leaderboard.
2. Arena Creation as You Go: Every few minutes, you’ll literally change the landscape of the game. You build the arena with each new function you write, creating new hazards and twists on the fly.
No two runs are the same, and it’s always about figuring out how to dodge what you just created! It’s like a rollercoaster you built yourself—and now you’re riding it!
3. Endless Action: Jump right into the action! Players don’t need to spend time setting things up. They’re immediately thrust into a high-speed, no-holds-barred arena where everything is out to get them.
The chaotic traffic won’t stop coming for you—ever. The thrill of survival keeps things intense as players feel the rush every second.
