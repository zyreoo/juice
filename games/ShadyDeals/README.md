**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Shady Deals is a fast-paced, pixel-art, text-free tycoon game where players smuggle contraband, evade the cops, and grow their underground empire through risky yet rewarding deals.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The game revolves around drag-and-drop smuggling, risk management, and strategic upgrades. Players manually move contraband between locations while avoiding law enforcement, indicated by a color-coded heat meter. Cops and rivals follow predictable movement patterns, adding a puzzle-like element to the game. As the player expands, they can upgrade vehicles, bribes, and hideouts, with each improvement visually reflected in the pixel-art world.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players buy or steal goods, then transport and sell them while avoiding police patrols. Each buyer reacts with simple emoji-like expressions, giving hints about risk levels. As players make more deals, law enforcement increases, requiring bribes or stealthier tactics. Successful trades unlock new locations, faster transport, and better hideouts, visually evolving the city from a run-down slum to a thriving crime hub.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**

The game offers quick, replayable sessions, gradually increasing difficulty as cops become more aggressive and rival gangs interfere. The world visually changes with crime growthâ€”neon signs light up, buildings improve, and police patrols intensify. Random events like sting operations or risky high-reward deals keep each session fresh.
