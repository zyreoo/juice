**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
BitSkiier is an online multiplayer skiing simulation where players can socialize while enjoying various parts of the skiing experience!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The main point of the game is to provide a fun way to hang out with friends. This game supports online multiplayer and proximity chat to support this vision, possibly helping you meet new people from around the world! Another key aspect is the skiing itself, which requires technical and controlled inputs, just like actual skiing.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- Line up and ride the ski lift up the mountain
- Ski down the hill
- Compete in time trials
- Refuel at the lodge to go again
We aim to capture the whole skiing experience with friends, bringing people closer together.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Interacting with others is the main way people will stay engaged. Talk with friends on the lift, race down the hill, show off your skills on the slopes, and grab a bite together. The game is created by its community, and we're just the platform bringing these people together.
