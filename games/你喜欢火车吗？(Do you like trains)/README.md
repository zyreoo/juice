你喜欢火车吗？: A 2d train management simulator game
Team Members: Billard Isidore (Easy Door)

How would you pitch your game in one line? "It's a pretty fast paced game with fast and good decision making required, you also need to think about optimisation"

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? Imagining new ways and tracks for your train to go faster! You need to be one step aheadn, seeing your small train tracks evolve into a complexe yet organized track system

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) 

You win money as people embarque on the train / loose money if you are late 

You buy train tracks/upgrades... 

More people arrive with new cities 

You rewire your traintrack system


How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? You will be busy trying your best to adapt to the changing environement and managing your ressources and speed! 
I might add a CO2/O2 system (like the train pollutes and you plant trees to improve the air quality (otherwise the map is filled with fog)) if I have time.
