### How would you pitch your game in one line?

The legendary story of Heracles in a platformer style with unique minigames, awaiting players in doing each of the labours. Some levels might include puzzles, chasing, exploration and of course, battles!

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?

**1. Cursor as a 2nd character:** It's still 'work in progress' but we're trying to incorporate a cursor as a second playable character for our game.

**2. Labours as mini-games:** With each labour being a separate challenge, players will have to find a unique way to complete it, 

**3. Knowledge of the Myth:** There will be a lot of references and easter eggs towards Greek mythology, which users will be able to use to their own advantage.

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Animatics:** Game includes a few short animatics / cut scenes to tell the basic background story as well as ending.

2. **Home / Caste:** The place to rest will be the castle with the king and many doors, each being an entrance to the new labour with next unlocking when you finish the previous one.

3 **Labours:** Each labour will fall under one or few of these categories: puzzles, chase, exploration, battle, and tell a story. There will be some extra platforming sections before the final boss to make it more entertaining and rewarding.

4 **Backtracking:** The players will be encouraged to return to the locations from previous labours to pick up items or just as a continuation of the story.

### How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

1. **Story:** It will follow the classical story of 12 labors of Hercules, which will appeal to the lovers of ancient Greece and mythology in general.

2. **Diversity of Labour-games:** Each labour will challenge the player in their own way, giving a variety of experiences.

3. **Focus on Arts:** Players will be able to enjoy the atmosphere / vibes of every chapter / labour with their own beautiful color palettes, music and backgrounds.

4. **Mechanics:** The 2-player nature of the game will make it more enjoyable to play with a partner and encourage collaboration in order to finish the game.

**Scope:** The initial game will feature:
- 2-3 Animatics.
- The room with the castle.
- 12 Mini-games - Labours.
- Two players: Platformer Character (Hercules) and Cursor (Hera?).

If creating all 12 labour will be challenging, we'll divide the game into two sections, the second one releasing as a DLC.
