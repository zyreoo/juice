**Team Members:** SparrowRat (me)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
2d platformer where you play as a rat with limited vision.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Limited vision requiring you to think on the fly as well as a focus on momentum conservation. Lower air control than most modern 2d platformers (more like smb1 than say, Celeste)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Fully linear(!) series of rooms. You platform to get to the next "screen". Occasional cutscenes.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Difficult platforming provides satisfaction for completing a room/making progress (at least for me!). Introduce more/different obsticles as you progress further into the game. Maybe puzzle elements too.
