# C.A.B. Control A Body

**Team Members:** Grant Yiu, Matthew Larm, Ken Zhao, Jack Yi

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A stereotypical dungeon crawler but you start from the boss room and and you can control defeated mobs.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You can use the bodies of different mobs you have defeated, and each mob grants special traits. You can use these against other mobs, allowing you to gain more powers. At the end, you fight the boss by stringing together combos from the different powers you've gained.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will make their way through a maze, taking down other mobs and controlling them to defeat each other. Each mob has a special trait or two that allow for special powers. Each mob controlled is like a meat shield, and cannot regenerate. When they die, you must switch to another mob.
Each mob you defeat adds 1 knowledge point of their power. There will be body generation pods throughout the maze that can make extra, stronger bodies to control by spending power knowledge points. To fight the final boss, you will use the knowledge points to infuse a newer, stronger body
to control to defeat the boss.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will face harder enemies and unlock new abilities as it progresses, keeping the game from becoming repetitive. For example, the ability to form your own body in the body tanks will allow for a lot of customization and unique gameplay.
