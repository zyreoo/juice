**How would you describe your game in one sentence?** Link between worlds meets Doom, but open world and with wall merging.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** Roguelike top down with wall merging, where you can shift your perspective to a 2D side scroller.
You will be able to upgrade your guns and fight intense bosses where the odds are against you.
The world is open to you from the beginning, but certain decisions will prove fatal for you. We based it on Legend of Zelda Link Between Worlds, Doom, and Enter the Gungeon.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** You start the game going to sleep, admiring your katana. You wake up in the night, watching your swords get stolen!
You follow the thief to the castle and find a gun on the floor and start fighting them, only for them to beat you. (But you learn the mechanics.) 
You wake up the next day in your house, understanding that they were too much for you. You now know what to do.
You set off on a journey training to beat them, fighting bosses and upgrading your gear, knowing that if you die, it's over.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** The variety of solving dungeons with a merging ability, along with a
looming threat that if you fail you restart, it will be sure to keep players hooked for potentially longer as they try to storm the castle as fast as you can.
Sometimes, you will think that you have hit a dead end, but there was a crack in the wall behind a painting (Spoilers) that may lead you to an unexpected miniboss (More Spoilers)
The game will be open source, so players can add their own bosses and weapons. Once you start to play, you'll be hooked.
