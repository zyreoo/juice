### How would you pitch your game in one line?
Roguelike Factory Automation. Think Mindustry or Factorio meets Balatro or Dead Cells.

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The slow progress of a Roguelike, and the Automation, Logistics and Optimisation of a factory automation game. And just soo much strategy, maybe too much, who knows?

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
- You start the game with a small chunk of land, storage, and one machine to gather simple resources (you pick from one of 2 to start with, stone and wood). You use those resources to create other machines to craft with, combine, build, gather, and more. You will be able to find crafting recipes by manually digging out sections of land with a shovel.
- But when nighttime falls, you need to defend against the land's dwellers, you
can build things like turrets and walls to defend yourself. Most dwellers' goals are to break your machinery and tools, and to steal your resources, but some carry different consquences like stealing land or recipies.
- Quickly you will find the area you start with is not really much, so
you'll need to expand your area, and doing so will introduce more space, more resources, more resource types, and worse dwellers.
- Once the player gets overwhelmed by dwellers, which *will* happen, and their resources are depleted the game resets; but any crafting recipies, machines,
and resource types are still unlocked, you can even choose to start with a new unlocked resource type.
- You win the game by having unlocked an amount of space (undecided)

### How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
As you start, the game feels like it's going speedy, and that you'll win this easy, then you unlock a new area, or build the wrong thing and it all comes crashing down. 
I hope to at least have the core mechanics finished and polished, and I'll make sure I have frameworks in place for if I wanted to add more resource types, for example.
