# White Silence

**Team Members:** Antony Wilson & Joel Bunyan

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
  Making your way back to civilization as you are deserted in the endless white

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
 The Key mechanics of the game would be Exploration, Scavenging, Navigation basically keeping yourself alive...

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
  The Player is  a scientist who has been abandoned by their colleagues in Antarctica.  The player will have to explore and navigate through the harsh conditions, scavenge for food and resources to keep him 
warm ( or else the player is dead). The core idea is for the player to survive and escape the Antarctic, there could be many possible ways for the player to esacpe one which is:
 - find components of a broken Radio towe, Repair it and send a distress signal .

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
  The cold slowly damages the player, so the player must keep warm by finding wood or fuel resources, keep his energy filled by finding food. The player can't stay in one place as it must move forward,
  There would be Point of Interest such as abandonded bases, outposts, wreckages etc.. The player is guided through breadcrumb trails. Footsteps, Dead Bodies, Old Journals. Unpredtictable dangers such as
  Ice Cracking, whiteouts, Avalanches, equipment failures etc..  There might be a twist or there might not.. Who knows....! The player must wade through this find the components necessary for his 
  escape off the **White Horizon**.
