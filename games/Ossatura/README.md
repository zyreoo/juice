**Team Members:** Siwen, Matt, Saman, Aiden

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Our game is like Undertale with Guitar Hero battle mechanics instead of bullet hell battle mechanics where you play as a skeleton to reunite your former bandmates in the afterlife. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Our key mechanics will be a compelling textless storyline, combined with rhythm game elements in order to create a battle system with depth.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The gameplay will consist of the main character venturing into dungeons and encountering battles in order to rescue your old bandmates and get the band back together.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

Our game will have random encounters, and boss fights with unique mechanics based on the themes and instruments of the enemies, and have 3 separate dungeons for the player to delve into in order to save their former bandmates.
