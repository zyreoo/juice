# Cradle Catchers

**Team Members:** Ramon de Leon, Lucas Martinez, Eduardo Amador, Adrian Rangel

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
A game where you catch `[TO BE DEFINED]` falling from the sky

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The main idea is the more `[TO BE DEFINED]` you've cought the more difficult it is to fly your plane, because of their weight or the pilot getting nervous. When you land you exchange the `[TO BE DEFINED]` for points in order to upgrade your plane.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You take off a boat and start catching `[TO BE DEFINED]` each `[TO BE DEFINED]` has a weigh that will make the plane more difficult to fly, and when you get to a certain point the plane will be to heavy to fly and will crash, in order to play for longer you need to land in another boat before you crash to redeem the `[TO BE DEFINED]` points, you use this points to upgrade your plane and try again

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Appart from a infinite mode there will most probably be a 'staged' mode where you need to get to the moon by adding upgrades to your plane to make it go higher and the higher up you are the weirder the controlls get
