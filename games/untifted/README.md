**How would you pitch your game in one line?** Imagine [Miegakure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yW--eQaA2I), but instead of a 3D slice of a 4D world, you play in a 2D slice of a 3D world. Plus the ecosystem of [Rain World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/). (I haven't played either game but both seem amazing.)

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** Moving and rotating in the larger three-dimensional world while interacting with the environment.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** You'll start out by playing a normal 2D platformer, but quickly discover powers able to move and rotate yourself in the larger 3D world. You'll use these powers to explore the world, solve tricky problems, and meet new creatures to progress in the story (TBD).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** By moving through the third dimension, the conditions, goals and difficulty of the game constantly change, so there will be alot to explore.
