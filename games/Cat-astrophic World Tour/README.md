**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Angry Birds meets Worms but with cats, quirky physics, and a global yarn-chasing adventure!"

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Turn-Based Projectile Combat:
Players take turns aiming and throwing quirky, cat-themed weapons (e.g., Yarn Balls, Fish Slaps, Laser Pointers) with unique physics and effects.
The challenge lies in mastering the trajectory, environmental interactions, and weapon combos.

Weapon Selection and Sequencing:
Players choose 3 weapons before each match, which cycle in a fixed order.
This adds a layer of strategy, as players must adapt to the sequence and use each weapon effectively.

Environmental Hazards and Interactions:
Arenas feature interactive elements like moving platforms, breakable objects, and wind gusts, making each match unpredictable and dynamic.

Humor and Visual Storytelling:
Exaggerated animations, slapstick humor, and expressive cat characters make the gameplay visually engaging and entertaining.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Single-Player Campaign:
Players progress through a series of levels set in cat-themed global locations (e.g., Sushi Kitchen, Egyptian Pyramid, Space Yarn Ship).
Each level introduces new challenges, enemies, and environmental hazards.
Players aim to defeat opponents, solve puzzles, and collect souvenirs to unlock new weapons and arenas.

PvP Mode ("Cat Clash Duel"):
Two players (or a player vs. AI) take turns throwing weapons at each other in a turn-based battle.
The goal is to deplete the opponent's health bar (shaped like a fishbone) using strategic weapon choices and environmental interactions.
Matches are short, fast-paced, and full of humorous moments.

Rewards and Progression:
Winning matches or completing levels rewards players with new weapons, accessories, and cutscene unlocks.
Collectible souvenirs from each location add replayability and encourage exploration.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?**
Variety in Gameplay:
The single-player campaign offers diverse levels with unique mechanics (e.g., conveyor belts in the Sushi Kitchen, low gravity in Space).
PvP mode provides endless replayability with different weapon combinations and arena dynamics.

Humor and Charm:
The game’s slapstick humor, expressive cat animations, and quirky weapon designs keep players entertained.
Cutscenes and visual gags between levels add narrative depth without words.

Short, Addictive Matches:
PvP matches are designed to be quick (2–3 minutes), making it easy to play "just one more round."
The single-player campaign is broken into bite-sized levels, perfect for short play sessions.

Progression and Unlockables:
Players are motivated to keep playing to unlock new weapons, arenas, and cutscenes.
Collectible souvenirs and hidden Easter eggs add an extra layer of exploration and reward.

Scope:
The game will feature 10–15 single-player levels across 5 unique locations, each with its own theme and mechanics.
PvP mode will include 5 arenas and 10+ weapons at launch, with potential for expansion.
