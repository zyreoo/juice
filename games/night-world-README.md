### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
This will be a 3d game with either a rotating 3rd-person camera or an isometric, fixed camera looking down from above.
Users will have to clear speficic dungeons and bosses around the game world to ultimately win, but the order is up to them.
As they play, they'll encounter enemies, replenish health points and hunger, and find weapons (and make sure they stay on top of durability!)
Instead of a level system, players will be able to increase the number of health and hunger points they have.
