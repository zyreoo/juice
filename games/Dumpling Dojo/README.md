# Dumpling Dojo

**Team Members:** KasCode, OliverHorvathCodes, rabbitlover101, avocadoahmed

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Imagine Dave the Diver but with evil rabbits, dumplings and karate. Granny Maeve is in crushing debt to the pesky real estate rabbits. Her only choice is to utilize her 47 years of karate experience to safely gather ingredients from the nearby forest to cook food at her restaurant.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Karate (challenge). Cooking (earning). Decorating (upgrading).
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

1. Morning: Gathering ingredients, where the challenge is hostile rabbits trying to steal your ingredients.
2. Afternoon: Cooking food and serving at your restaurant. Tips go to decorating, actual earnings go to the debt.
3. Night: Decorating the restaurant with the tips you earned.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Researching/discovering more recipes which sell for more but also require more exotic ingredients.
Getting more exotic ingredients is increasingly challenging as more skilled enemies appear.
