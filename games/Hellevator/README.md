**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Ultrakill but its just a middle aged man swept into hell from an elevator from his office apartment.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The movement and weapons should make it pretty clear to the player that this is meant to be a FPS/Speedrunning game. Meaning there's no limit to how fast you can go. Any strategy you find, use it.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
*elevator dings* You are now in hell, then the elevator opens and you're forced to punch off a few enemies chasing you. Based on "The 7 Sins", we will have levels based on these, which the player can go through, and a final boss as well.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Speedrunning is a genre, and people like to perfect their times. Make them fall into the trap of improvement. That feeling that "I could do a LITTLE bit better" and have them entrapped into the game for eternity.. or as long as you like :)

And also fun ways to use the items provided in the game, and use them the way you like it, instead of there being a designed way. So players can have fun and y'know, "improvement" ;)
