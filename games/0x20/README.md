**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
a space exploration game like KSP2, but less spacecraft design and more logistics.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
the fun comes from the restrictions on energy and materials that gradually become easier and easier to manage. ideally, we want to have a cookie-clicker type progression, where you grow exponentially.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
the game consists of sending missions out, managing anything that happens to them, receiving materials, building new infrastructure, and repeating. over time, players will build more and more stuff, which will allow them to reach farther and farther, allowing them to build more and more stuff. this "stuff" consists of dyson spheres, space elevators, moon bases, and more.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
the 30 minutes will probably be spent on colonising the entire solar system, although we might extend into the entire galaxy depending on how much time we have. to make sure the player actually has something to shoot for, we might add goals to complete or a leaderboard.
