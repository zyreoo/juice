# Monster Tactics

**Team Members:** Caroline Soffer, Aaron Soffer

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like tower defense from the monster POV -- take a turn at being the bad guys for once!
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The player must strategically decide when and where to place monsters in order to destroy all the towers and get to the princess. There are resource based constraints on the monsters to make gameplay engaging. Some monsters will also have activatible ingame abilities, such as a speed boost, so the player must use strategic timing to win.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**


Players will go through a series of increasingly difficult levels where monsters have to rush increasingly elaborate tower setups.
As the players make their way through the levels they will unlock new monsters and abilities. Players will be able to save up some form of currency in order to buy new boosts.
