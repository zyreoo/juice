# Eyes to Reality

**Team Members:** Nathaniel and Eli

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A platformer with some puzzle elements where things act differently based on whether you are looking at them.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
If you are looking at certain objects or platforms they will act differently than if you are not looking at them.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will be progressing through increasingly hard levels, while new mechanics are introduced, like doors that close if you can't see a certain object, moving platforms, and enemies.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Over time the levels will get harder, as well as continuously introducing new mechanics.
