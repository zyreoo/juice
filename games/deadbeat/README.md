**How would you pitch your game in one line?**<br>
A top-down twin-stick shooter, crossed with a rhythm game.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**<br>
We think that having to time your shots to the beat of a song will make a traditionally button-mashy genre feel more technical, positional, and visceral. By committing your actions to the beat of the song, your attacks will do more damage, your abilities will have a stronger or secondary effect, and you will feel a whole lot cooler. While sloppily spamming shots can work for some small scrappy enemies, honing your abilities in sync with the soundtrack will be vital to maximizing your effectiveness, and will be necessary to fend off the game’s later waves of challenging foes.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**<br>
Players move through combat arenas, fighting enemies in sync with the music using beat-timed shooting and dodging. Perfectly timed shots increase damage, build combos, and trigger special effects, while enemies attack in rhythmic patterns, forcing strategic movement. Power-ups, weapons, and upgrades enhance gameplay. Boss fights sync dramatically with the music, and as difficulty increases, new enemy types, mechanics, and remixed tracks keep the experience fresh and challenging.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**<br>
The player will move through rooms fighting enemies and collecting items & upgrades, getting more powerful as they traverse floors. The gameplay should feel flashy and exciting, keeping the player absorbed, and there should be constant rewards of money or items. The game will have multiple randomly-generated floors containing enemies unique to each floor. There will be a boss at the end of each floor.
