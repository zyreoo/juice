# ChangeThrough

**Team Members:** Ariadne Moutsouri

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's your average platformer game, but there are walls that you have to pass through, in a not-so-platformer way.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game uses puzzle-like exploration mechanics, such as finding hidden objects, or having to create them yourself, and action mechanics, 
such as jumping, dashing, and sliding. These mechanics interact with each other and the player must combine them to find out how they should pass each level. 
The player must detect objects, within action, that will be used to reach the next level.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Each level is separated by a wall. To reach the next level, the player must pass through the wall. The wall, however, can only be passed by destroying it, 
using objects, or by passing through secret passageways instead. These objects and passageways can sometimes be found inside the level, 
but the player will mostly have to create them. The goal of the game is slightly metaphorical. The point is for the players to understand that 
in order to overcome an obstacle (the walls), one must change their perception of their surroundings, and find unusual ways to utilise them in a way that benefits them. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game is essentially a platformer that uses action and puzzles to pass through each level. The puzzles are never, ever the same. 
Sometimes they might look as if the solution to one puzzle is the same or similar to the solution of a previous puzzle, but that only happens to trick the players. 
The solutions to all puzzles differ from each other, keeping the players engaged for 30 minutes until they finish all levels.
