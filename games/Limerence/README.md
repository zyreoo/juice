# Limerence

**Team Members:** Tongyu

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
GRIS meets [Beat Totems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMaO5vaMZtM) in a metroidvania-esque exploration of limerence, love, longing — and music.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Every action contributes to the music, and the world responds to the player's movement. As the player progresses, they experience a visual and interactive representation of the stages of a crush and heartbreak :) 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player platforms across a 2D world and solves puzzles to collect and swap out beat blocks. The player also unlocks new movement abilities as they progress through different sections — they have to backtrack across a landscape that changes with every stage of the game. The beat blocks will then open doors to allow the player to progress in the game.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be 5(ish) visually distinct sections of the game with an overarching narrative that uses music as a metaphor for emotion. Each section uses the different abilities of the player to keep the puzzles interesting!
