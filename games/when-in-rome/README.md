**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
Think of a hidden object game where you have to blend in with the rest of a town to get around.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The player really has to think to be able to figure out how to blend in with the behaviors of the citizens of the town to find clues.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
The player is meant to blend into a foreign town in order to find out how to exit using clues around the town. They must observe certain behaviors, like not touching certain colors, or not getting too close to eachother.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
The player will go through many different stages where they have to guess how to get closer to an answer on how to exit while also having to remember how NPCs act.
