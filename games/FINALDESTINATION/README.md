**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Imagine the entire history of the universe, as an exploration game, with every challenging mechanic known to man. It's as big as you imagine. Here we go.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**}
Lots of tiny minigames, exploration, unpredictability as to what happens next.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The core game loop will be traversing the entire known timeline. It will be an open exploration game, mainly trying to get by as a person attempting to survive in all the different time periods out there, starting from the big bang. They'll be challenged by the environment, other entites they meet in cutscenes, etc.

Minigames will be inspired from stuff like Friday Night Funkin, Beatsaber, geometry dash, portal 2, the last of us, INSIDE, aimlabs, etc. Pretty much any game challenge out there. It'll be required to get certain items to complete levels. Doing things perfectly will unlock achievements.

H**ow will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each "stage" so to speak will be a completely different level with new art, mechanics, etc. It's not very predictable and changes a ton. I think it's doable though because I'll have a reference for most of the gameplay and it will mostly be a challenge of reimplementing stuff I've already invested hundreds in.
