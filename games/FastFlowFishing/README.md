# Fast Flow Fishing

**Team Members:** Eric Xie, Simon Monagas

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a racing and fishing game mixed together, with a bit of a rhythm game as well!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The point of fishing is to allow you to catch fast fish, which you can then use to go race against other fish. Placing well allows you to earn more money, allowing you to get better gear, and better fish!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players go through a rhythm game to catch fish, and catching the fish allows them to race that fish elsewhere. Catching more fish or performing well in races makes money for the player, allowing them to constantly upgrade their gear and improve.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be engaged as once they get tired of one aspect of the game, they can move onto another aspect, keeping the game engaging and fun! The catching aspect of the game and the racing aspect of the game will also increase in difficultly over time, providing a challenging aspect for the players to experience as well.
