A kid gets lost while playing and he is trying to find his way back home.

## What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The key mechanics that make it fun are looking for clues, overcoming obstacles, and surviving alone. 

## How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
Players try to find the kid’s way back home, they will have to find food for the kid to eat, and will earn XP when they find clues and live longer.

## How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
They will have to solve puzzles, look for keys, and survive. And this will keep players engaged.
