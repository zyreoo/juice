# DuctTape

**Team Members:** Endercass <contact@endercass.me>

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You are a cave man who explores caves for shelter and signs of early society, just like anyone else in your time, except you found a mysterious relic: duct tape! 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The magical roll of duct tape is able to combine nearly anything you can find to build your own weaponry and tools

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Player travels to cave and finds all sorts of materials that can be taped together to form different types of tools. 
Nearly every item can be slotted into the templates (even things that make absolutely no sense) to varying levels of success. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be encouraged to be creative and develop their own solutions to the difficult challenges they may face.
Each cave will have many pathways and opportunities to explore and players must build the correct tools in order to pass certain points. 

Ex: A player might reach a certain part of a cave that can only be reached with a grappling hook-styled item. 
There may not be a simple grappling hook template but if you build a sword template with a rope shaft you can throw it. 

You can return to home base at any point during your cave run or travel to a located group of cave men who may also have a base set up. (These function as checkpoints)
