**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A space exploration game where you customize your ship to explore different planets in a dungeon crawler.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key gameplay mechanics that will make this game fun are the orbital mechanics and combat. I want the orbital mechanics to mimic that of kerbal space program, but in 2d. This means that the players will be able to do things like gravity assists and transfers between celestial bodies. I want the combat to have variable difficulty based on the level of the dungeon they are on, so it is constantly engaging. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will be able to customize and upgrade their spaceship at a facility on each planet. Their will be planet-specific modifications and upgrades that have different effects and looks. Players will have to navigate through space with limited amounts of fuel and make custom transfers. This will be difficult but the complexities of the transfers will increase as the game goes on, hopefully matching the players ability. Each planet will act as a dungeon, with the reward at the end being more fuel to travel to the next planet. The players will have to explore different rooms in the dungeon and fight enemies of adjustable difficulty.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The players will remain engaged throughout the game because they will want to upgrade their ship, and explore as much of the universe as possible. After making it to a new planet, players will clear the dungeon, upgrade their ship, and get more fuel to make it to the next planet. These planets will act as checkpoints to allow players to make mistakes and keep trying to get their orbit transfer right. The planets are equivalent to levels, with multiple levels per planet dungeon. I want one level to take ~20 minutes to let players experience a full cycle in one sitting.
