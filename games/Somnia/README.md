**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A child trapped in dream experiments must escape as nightmares bleed into reality.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is shifting between dream and reality, where puzzles and threats change based on the environment, keeping gameplay unpredictable and tense.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
In this game, players control a child trapped in a lab where they are forced into recurring nightmares. Each segment begins with the child entering a surreal dream world, where they must solve puzzles that manipulate dream logic while avoiding nightmarish creatures. After surviving a few nightmares, they wake up in a distorted version of the facility, where reality itself is warped with nightmare elements. The player must explore, solve more complex puzzles, and survive the increasingly dangerous facility, all while being stalked by a growingly powerful entity. As the two worlds merge, players adapt to shifting mechanics and use abilities from both realms to confront the entity and either escape, destroy the facility, or merge with the nightmare.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
We will keep players engaged by having an interesting plot and some lore to the game which will be unveiled slowly as the game progresses, with changing elements and twists throughout.
