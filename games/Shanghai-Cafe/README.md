- **Customer Management:** Players must quickly understand and fulfill unique orders from a variety of customers, each with their own patience levels.
- **Equipment Chaos:** Machines and tools can break, spill, or get clogged, requiring players to fix them before it causes trouble.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** Customers can get mad or leave if they don’t get their orders in time, adding pressure and excitement to the gameplay.

2. **Equipment & Maintenance:** Players interact with various cafe equipment like espresso machines, ovens, and blenders, handling tasks like brewing, toasting, and repairing.
