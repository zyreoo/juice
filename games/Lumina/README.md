**Team Members:** Balogh Barnabás

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like watching life unfold in a dance of light and shadow—each beam revealing a story from birth to death."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
Dynamic light manipulation allows players to interact with and transform their environment, unlocking hidden elements that reflect the stages of life.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Players guide a fragile light through a dark, abstract world by solving puzzles that reveal new areas and trigger environmental changes.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
Progressively challenging puzzles (and) evolving visuals, along with soundscapes, keep the experience fresh. This immerses players in a metaphorical journey that mirrors life's transitions. However, the game will continue to develop as you play, changing and adapting to maintain interest.
