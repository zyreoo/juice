**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A mysterious, atmospheric exploration game set on an endless, ever-changing train filled with strange creatures and hazards.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Exploration and Discovery: Players move through different, well designed train cars filled with strange environments, hidden paths, and mysterious creatures.
Environmental Interaction: The train is full of dynamic hazards (moving parts, fires, water...) that players must learn to navigate and use to their advantage.
Creature Encounters: Strange creatures inhabit the train, and players can avoid, observe, or use the environment to deal with them.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players move between designed train cars, each with unique themes and challenges (dark, flooded, mechanical, etc.).
It will be possible to interact with environmental elements to progress (ex: switching levers, moving parts, lighting fires...) while avoiding creatures that roam the train.
Some creatures will attack if provoked, others will remain passive unless disturbed. Players need to learn their behavior and find ways to avoid or use them.
Players can collect light sources, tools, and other items to survive or reveal hidden paths.
The ultimate goal is to reach the front of the train, where the trainâ€™s origin is revealed.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?**

The game thrives on discovery. Having many train cars with unique environments and mechanics. 
The pace is slow and immersive, allowing for deep exploration without overwhelming the player.
