# Fear of Cold

**Team Members:** spectr

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Quake meets Bioshock, but you're trying to stay warm

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
So, the key mechanic that makes it fun is gonna be staying warm. Originally I wanted to go with a timestop mechanic ala jjba, but it turned out to be way too hard from a coding AND gameplay standpoint. I was playing around with func_godot, DUSK, and looking at some brutalist moodboards before I got the inspiration of a slower, half-like FPS about trying to stay warm in a frozen hellscape.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game's a linear FPS that plays like a survival horror! Ammo is tight and you'll need to stay warm as you trek through the arctic. Sources of heat will include generators, temporary torches, campfires, etc.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
So, the first 30 minutes are gonna drop the player into a tutorial level -- introduce basic fps mechanics with the gun & inventory interactions before we send them out into the arctic to find salvation. The main driving force behind the game is gonna be func_godot since I have plenty of level design experience and I think I can put together a really good experience with more control over the engine.
