Game Pitch:"void Station:survival Orbit"

ONE-LINE Pitch:"Manage A FLOATING SPACE STATION INFESTED WITH ALIEN PARASITES—ALLOCATE RESOURCES,SACRIFICE CREWS,AND UNLOCK MYSTERIOUS TECHNOLOGY TO SURVIVE UNTIL RESCUE ARRIVES."

KEY MECHANICS:

• RESOURCE TRIAGE:Scavenge limited oxygen,power,and medicine from derelict ships,but risk attracting alien swarms.Prioritize which sections of the station to keep alive(e.g.,life support vs.labs).

• CREW MORALE:Assign tasks to stressed crewmates(e.g.,repair broken systems,defend against parasites),but overworking them leads to mutiny or suicide.

• ALIEN EVOLUTION:Parasites mutate based on your choices—ignoring a swarm in the engine room might create faster,deadlier variants.

• MYSTERY UNLOCKING:Decrypt alien tech to gain perks(e.g.,teleportation,force fields)but risk corrupting the station’s core.

CORE LOOP:

1. SURVEY:Send drones to scan nearby derelicts for supplies,but avoid triggering alarms that summon aliens.

2. ALLOCATE:Distribute resources to critical systems(e.g.,shields,medical bays)while crew pleads for help in other zones.

3. DEFEND:Deploy crew to fight off parasite waves using guns or improvised tools(e.g.,welding torches).

4. ADAPT:Use alien tech to gain advantages,but each upgrade risks a catastrophic system failure.

ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

• PERMA-DEATH:Crew deaths are permanent,but their memories grant passive bonuses(e.g.,a deceased engineer’s notes unlock faster repairs).

• RANDOM EVENTS:Daily crises like reactor meltdowns,crew betrayals,or mysterious alien signals offering risky rewards.

• TIME PRESSURE:Rescue is 30 days away,but each day brings escalating threats—can you survive without losing your humanity?

UNIQUE HOOK:The station’s AI narrates your choices in a sarcastic,unreliable tone,mocking your failures or gaslighting you into risky decisions.

PLAYER EXPERIENCE:A tense,morally ambiguous strategy game where every choice feels like a gamble—and the aliens are always evolving.
