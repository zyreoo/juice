**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "The organization and psychological horror genres meet in this game about moving in a haunted house."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is organizing items into shelves/drawers or cleaning. It's fun because of the satisfaction of cleaning/organization and can also be relaxing and 
motivating for the player. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player is moving in and must either unpack boxes to organize into shelves/drawers or clean up items to put into boxes. Each room (e.g. living, bath)
 is a level and each room has certain areas that need organizing. They are trying to achieve the correct placements of items for successful organization while facing 
 small puzzles (e.g. quick time events, searching for objects in the scene). 
 The reward is moving onto the next room and progressing the story abt the ghost that haunts the house.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
We plan to invest a lot of time into visuals and story so that the game is calming and/or terrifying depending on the player's progress. As well, we will be creative
in our level design (like what exactly the player is organizing; a creative idea could be a plushie collection in a bedroom) In certain areas, there will be a horror 
elements (e.g. jumpscare, something moves by itself) that encourages the player to keep playing and find out what's going on.
