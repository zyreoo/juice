**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like a first-person melee slasher meets extreme parkour, with fast-paced, fluid movement mechanics that evolve with every level."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The core mechanics focus on dynamic, highly responsive movement like sliding, grappling, double jumping, wall jumping, and slide jumping. These mechanics allow for a fluid, exhilarating experience that challenges players to master their control over movement. The game encourages creativity as players adapt their movement style to fit different level environments, making each stage feel fresh and exciting.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players navigate through levels designed around the dynamic movement system, where they’ll need to jump, slide, grapple, and wall-jump to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Each level presents new challenges that require players to adjust their movement techniques, ensuring that they are constantly learning and improving. The main goal is to reach the end of each level while dealing with the obstacles in creative ways, with rewards coming in the form of level progression and power-ups that enhance movement or combat.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game keeps players engaged by introducing increasingly complex movement challenges, ensuring each level feels unique and requires new approaches. Since the core controls are simple—just WASD for movement and clicks to attack—players can jump right into the action without a lengthy learning curve. As players master basic mechanics, the game’s levels evolve to incorporate more obstacles, environmental changes, and movement techniques. With the ability to easily add new levels and tweak challenges, the game remains fresh and engaging for longer play sessions, encouraging players to keep progressing through new stages
