**Title:** Dante's Journey

**Pitch in one line:** A cooperative adventure game inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy, where players must overcome trials and gather resources through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.

**Key Mechanics:**

- **Cooperation:** Two players, tethered together by a mystical rope, must work together to navigate platforms and defeat enemies. The rope can be used to swing, climb, and descend between platforms.
- **Exploration:** Each level represents a circle of Hell, a level of Purgatory, or a realm of Paradise, with unique challenges inspired by sins and virtues.
- **Resource Gathering:** Throughout the journey, players collect resources to improve their "Garden of Redemption," which grows as they progress through the game.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**

Players navigate a series of platforming levels inspired by the circles of Hell and levels of Purgatory, collecting resources to build and enhance their garden. They jump, climb, extend, and release the rope, facing environmental challenges and solving puzzles based on sins and virtues.

**Player Engagement:**

Each level introduces new challenges and increases in difficulty, keeping players engaged through the continuous discovery of new environments and challenges.

**Scope of the Game:**

The game is divided into three main stages:

- **Hell:** Players face the sins and monsters of Hell, gathering dark resources for their garden.
- **Purgatory:** The second stage involves purification and gathering celestial resources, facing trials of virtue.
- **Paradise:** The final stage involves reaching Paradise and collecting divine resources, facing angelic challenges and puzzles.

In each stage, players build and enhance their "Garden of Redemption" with the resources they collect, discovering new truths and facing increasingly challenging trials.
