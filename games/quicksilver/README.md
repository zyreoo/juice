# Game Name

**Team Members:** Kevin Xie

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A 2d roguelike, topdown like Enter the Gungeon, but with an emphasis on speed.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player will not have health, but instead there will be a timer counting down. The player will lose time if they are hit, and can gain time if they kill enemies or enter new rooms. To add to the
frantic pace, the player will be encouraged to fight in close quarters and will be given lots of mobility. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Its a roguelike, with 3-4 floors and 10-12 rooms a floor. The player must finish the game before the timer runs out. If they die or fail, they will have to restart from the first room of the first floor, 
but will be able to collect coins throughout the dungeon that they can use to purchase power ups to make it easier. At the end of each floor is a boss, which is the only room per floor that is 
guaranteed to remain the same. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
As it is a roguelike, assuming they can't beat the dungeon on their first try, i will make the combat and enemies unqiue so they feel encouraged to try again.
