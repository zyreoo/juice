# Exploding-Cats

**Team Members:** Jamie Chopon

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like Valorant/CSGO meets Tower defense but with little cats

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]

The key mechanic is entering a site, and planting the bomb. This going to be fun because you can shoot a bunch of angry robots, and can see the bomb explode a big robot factory. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]

Main premise: 

Players have a roadtrip map for robot factories they have to explode, with the final location being the final ultron boss.
To explode the factories they have to enter the site and plant the bomb.
Once the bomb is planted, they have to protect it until the timer finishes.
When the timer finishes, they have to escape to the rescue helicopter.
When entering the bomb site, protecting the bomb, and running away to the rendezvous point. The player has to defeat robots with their given tools.
The factories will gain in difficulty and have new robots the player must learn to defeat.
The Final boss will be the brother cat controlling a giant robot. (Sad cutscene)
To defeat the boss the player has to plant and protect three bombs.
Then when the bombs explode, (If I have enough time) there would a cat-chase of the evil cat.
When the evil cat is caught and put in jail. The player completes the game.

Mechanics:

The player will start of with a pistol, and level up weapons as they go.
When the player completes a location, they collect coins and scraps.
Coins can be used to buy Soldier Cats or new weapons, and Scraps are used to build Robot Turrets.
Soldiers cats will go seek out robots and break them. They have limited health until they get destroyed.
Robot turrets are stationary turrets that will shoot the evil robots. They have more health than soldier cats.
The player can level up their Soldiers Cats and Turrets.
The weapons progression goes Pistol-SMG-Rifle-Sniper/Machine Gun.
(If I have enough time) The robots will have different types that the player will learn to defeat as they progress.
(If I learn how to draw haha) Player can buy skins, maybe boba cat or batman cat.


How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

The player will be engaged for 30 minutes because of the multitude of maps, and how the player must be active in protecting the bomb for a certain duration.
Also, the difficulty will increase so the player has to be engaged in learning how to handle the new challenges.
