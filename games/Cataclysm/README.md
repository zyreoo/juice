**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like *Stray* meets *Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time* but with a time-traveling cat and a world-altering cataclysmic power.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

*   **Time Travel:** Players can manipulate time (potentially slowing, reversing, or fast-forwarding it within a limited radius) to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and gain tactical advantages in combat. This allows for creative problem-solving and dynamic gameplay.
*   **Cataclysm:** A powerful ability that allows the cat to unleash a devastating energy blast, wiping out enemies and potentially altering the environment. This provides a sense of power and can be used strategically for crowd control or to overcome challenging encounters. However, it has a significant cooldown or resource cost, making its use strategic.
*   **Agile Movement:** The cat's natural agility is emphasized. Players can climb, jump, and dash with fluid, responsive controls. This allows for exploration of the open world and provides a fast-paced, action-oriented feel to combat and traversal. Wall running, ledge grabbing, and other cat-like maneuvers could be incorporated.
*   **Curse Removal:** The ability to see and remove curses adds a layer of strategic depth. Players must identify cursed characters or objects and then use the mechanic to cleanse them, potentially revealing secrets, unlocking new areas, or changing the behavior of NPCs.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

1.  **Exploration:** Players explore the open world, discovering new areas, interacting with NPCs (human and animal), and uncovering clues about the game's story.
2.  **Time Manipulation Puzzles:** Players encounter environmental puzzles that require them to use their time travel ability to manipulate objects, activate mechanisms, or bypass obstacles.
3.  **Combat Encounters:** Players engage in combat with various enemies (birds, snakes, rats, and potentially larger bosses). They utilize their claw attacks, agile movement, and time manipulation to defeat foes. The Cataclysm ability provides a powerful option for dealing with large groups or tough enemies.
4.  **Questing:** Players receive quests from NPCs, which involve exploring specific areas, collecting items, or interacting with other characters. Completing quests progresses the story and unlocks new abilities or areas.
5.  **Curse Removal:** Players identify and remove curses from characters or objects, which can lead to rewards, story progression, or changes in the game world.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

*   **Varied Environments:** The game features diverse environments, from ancient Egypt to futuristic laboratories, each with its own unique challenges and visual style. This keeps the exploration fresh and exciting.
*   **Unlocking Abilities:** As players progress, they unlock new abilities and upgrades, such as enhanced time manipulation powers, new combat moves, or improved agility. This provides a sense of progression and expands gameplay possibilities.
*   **Compelling Story:** The story of a time-traveling cat and the consequences of altering history provides a narrative hook that keeps players invested.
*   **Challenging Puzzles:** The puzzles are designed to be challenging but not frustrating, requiring players to think creatively and utilize their time manipulation abilities effectively.
*   **Dynamic Combat:** The combat system is fast-paced and engaging, rewarding skillful movement, timing, and strategic use of abilities. Boss battles provide unique challenges that test the player's skills.
*   **Collectibles and Secrets:** Hidden throughout the world are collectibles and secrets that reward exploration and add to the game's replay value.
*   **Open World Exploration:** The open world encourages exploration and allows players to discover new areas and challenges at their own pace.

The initial scope of the game involves the core mechanics of time travel, Cataclysm, agile movement, and curse removal. As development progresses, the scope can be expanded to include more environments, abilities, enemies, and story content. The focus for the first 30 minutes will be introducing the core mechanics, the world, and establishing the initial narrative hook of the cat's time-traveling adventure.

This is a prototype of the projects README, we will update on it as we go.
