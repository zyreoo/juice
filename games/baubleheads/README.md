# Baubleheads

**Team Members:** Andre Snellings Jr. & Charles Margolis

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Pikmin meets Enter the Gungeon with top down roguelike gameplay and Mario and Luigi style Bros Attacks.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Building a crew of Baubleheads, little gemstone creatures with unique statistical attributes and elemental effects.
Defeating enemies to collect geodes, items that can be used to add more Baubleheads to your army or grant them new powers correlating to the geode obtained.
Traverse procedurally generated dungeons with unique enemies and geodes.
Collect scrolls which grant your player new abilities to interact with their Baubleheads, similar to the whistle from Pikmin or the Bro's attacks from the Mario and Luigi series. 
Inflict multiple elemental stadus effects onto enemies to trigger elemental combo attacks inspired by games like Genshin Impact or Divinity: Original Sin.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will venture through caves with only their Baubleheads to protect them. They will build up and level up their Baubleheads to help defeat enemies, fighting bosses to help them escape the mines.
The player will get abilites to help control their Baubleheads to deal more damage or keep each other alive.  Without keeping a watchful eye on each Baublehead, the player may end up alone, and they are significantly weak alone.
Topdown movement with WASD, mouse for attacking, and potentially Q or E for additional attack options.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will have many build options through the 6 Baublehead variants and their elemental synergies, as well as the permanent and equippable upgrades available, not to mention the scrolls and unique player attacks you can reach. The randomized nature of a roguelike should also help keep gameplay fresh.
We'd like to have 6 types of Baubleheads, one piece of equipment for each, and 8-10 player abilities.
Unsure of the amount of stages, but likely 3 areas (2 levels and 1 boss per area) and 1 final boss
