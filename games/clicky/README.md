# Game Name

**Team Members:** Daniel Jin

**How would you pitch your game in one line?** 2D platformer taking place in an operating system, where you play as a cursor and interact with UI elements

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** Finding ways to use UI elements to advance in levels, such as by activating icons that open windows you can jump on 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** 
You play as Clicky, the magic cursor living in the operating system. The player can run programs by navigating Clicky over icons and pressing a keybind.
To start the game, you have Clicky click on a virus, which encrypts Clicky's friends and leaves the operating system in a dysfunctional state.
You must navigate this broken landscape to defeat this virus and bring order to the world.

The game has multiple levels, each level centers around using UI elements to provide boosts or platforms you can manipulate and jump on.
Each level finishes with a boss fight with the virus. Defeating each boss unlocks some helpful friends, such
as a web browser that takes you to an upgrade store.

The goal is to reach the final level and defeat the virus for good.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
I plan on around 3 levels that take at least ten minutes each.
