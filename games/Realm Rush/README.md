**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a roguelike based off the mechanics of Slayin with point and click shooting.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You are constantly moving while precisely shooting monsters, which makes avoiding taking damage challenging. The player
is either moving left or right. You aren't allowed to stop, but you can turn the other way.s

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Enter the cursed realm, you must keep moving and shooting to survive waves of enemies. Each enemy will money to allow you 
to purchase upgrades. Each floor will swarm you with more enemies with more health. The goal is to survive as long as possible 
and get as points as possible for permenant upgrades, unlock acheivements, and to beat a final boss.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will play to gain achievements (unlocking new upgrades), find which upgrades will help them win, beat old scores,
and beat the final boss.
