### How would you pitch your game in one line?

It is a heartfelt story about a young girl who has lost her way, her family, and herself, but through an epic journey to find home, she finds friends, meaning, and most importantly, she finds herself.

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?

1. **Open world:** There will be a large map with many places the player could go, many changing the story, leaving the fate of the character in the player's hands.

2. **Freedom of Choice:**  There will be many endings to the game, or at least many paths to find the end of the game, depending on how the user wants to progress the story

3. **A little frog friend:** Along the way, a little frog friend set on helping the young girl find home leads you on the journey

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Introduction (of course):** The story will begin with a decent cutscene, to explain what happened and where the player is now, and in that there will be intractable pieces, which will also serve as a tutorial

2. **Little help:** Then the player will be a little guided to begin with, until they find their frog friend, who will help them on their way, opening the game up to many possibilities and the open world

3. **Collection:** The main tasks after that will be collecting items or pieces of items that will help her remember the past, help her towards her family, or towards a bigger picture that will help her find herself

4. **Side quests:** There will be plenty of little side quests to help your character along, giving useful items, health, and other helpful things

1. **Diverse Gameplay:** A combination of the open world and the many quests to find the ending will make each player have a unique experience
 
2. **Heartfealt Characters:** Characters and interactions that really connect to the player and keep them engaged with the story, curious to uncover the end

3. **Uniqe art:** The game will feature a unique and relaxing art and feel which will add to the story and improve ambiance

**Scope:** The initial game will feature:
- 1-2 Basic story paths
- 5-8 Main Story quests
- A smaller open map
