The Life of a Cat (working title!)

**Team Members:** @tajraniya (Raniya)
**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like the scrapbook mechanic inspired from Omori meets the themes of saying goodbye from SpiritFarer, about your cat!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is the scrapbook, and mapping the items that made the identity/personality of your cat to the scrapbook. The scrapbook is the main feature, and drives the story forward!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The main goal of the game is to complete the scrapbook with all 5-6 photos of your beloved cat, to have a proper send-off! So, the player needs to complete a few mini-games to get all the items (platformer, dodging, etc.), and assemble the items to make the scrapbook as the final challenge!

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
I hope the change between the 5-6 mini-games to find the items, the music, the art, and the anticipation to see the completed scrapbook and sending off your cat will capture players for 30+ minutes!
