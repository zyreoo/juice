**Game Name**: *Shattered Echoes*

**Team Members**: Utkarsh Nande

**One-Line Pitch**: "It's like Hyper Light Drifter meets Dead Cells, 
but you weaponize light and shadows to reshape the environment and outsmart evolving enemies."

**Key Mechanics**:  
- *Light/Shadow Manipulation*: Toggle between light (burn enemies, melt obstacles) and shadow (cloak, set traps).  
- *Echo System*: Death resets the run, but environmental changes persist, creating shortcuts for future runs.  
- *Symbiotic Orb*: Attack and cloak modes swapped mid-combat for hybrid effects.  

**Core Game Mechanics**:  
Players use light to burn enemies and shadow to set traps, toggling between them for tactical advantage. Light attracts stronger enemies, while shadow limits visibility, creating a dynamic risk-reward system. The orb companion offers extra combat depth with mid-combat mode swaps. The Echo system ensures each death feels meaningful, with changes to the environment that persist across runs, rewarding experimentation and adaptation.

**Core Game Loop**:  
- **Objective**: Survive in procedurally generated biomes and collect Echo Fragments to unlock upgrades.  
- **Loop**: Explore biomes, solve puzzles with light/shadow, fight adaptive enemies, die, and learn by retaining environmental changes.  

**Engagement**:  
- *Procedural Biomes*: Each run offers fresh challenges.  
- *Adaptive Enemies*: Foes evolve based on player strategies.  
- *Meta-Progression*: Unlock shortcuts, abilities, and orb cosmetics.  

**Scope**:  
1 biome (Neon Wasteland), 
3 enemy types,
1 boss
Simple controls: Move, aim, swap modes. 
Permadeath with persistenceâ€”retain key environmental changes.
