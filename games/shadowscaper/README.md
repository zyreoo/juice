**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "It's like [Game X] meets [Game Y] but with [Unique Element Z]" (doesn't have to follow this format)]
it's olaf's situation with wanting to remain frozen in the summertime except you're a shadow navigating a world of light

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]
it's single player, so you can lose yourself in another world where you're trying to constantly avoid light sources and manipulate objects to cast darkness and cast new shadows to keep moving. 

it has a basic 2D layout, and it's a platformer game where you'll have to effectively time your movements and use what you have around you to beat the odds.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
players will have a shadow as an avatar, and they will complete a series of levels. each level consists of various obstacles (lamps, candles, anything with light that can erase shadows easily)

each level ends when nighttime falls, which is after a certain time interval. as the levels progress, the difficuly will also increase. every six levels will unlock a new location, and the next six levels will be in that specific location. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]

players will stay engaged by completing the levels. new obstacles will be introduced to increase difficulty, and incentives will be awarded through a point system to be used within the levels (ex. power-ups).
