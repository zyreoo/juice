# Echoes Of Gold

**Team Members:** @Fra146, @Invunnom

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a metroidvania game like The Last Faith, with dynamic and exciting combat, but it takes place in another time

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player is able to quickly change combat style, and using these combat styles together will help him defeat certain enemies instead of others

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The core game loop takes place like a platformer, with different worlds and levels

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The players will be engaged by the mysterious story and characters, and will be drawn forward by their desire of seeking the truth. The game will involve a tutorial, bosses and mini-bosses, a mysterious story with an ending.
