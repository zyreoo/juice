How would you pitch your game in one line?
The game is about getting back the wifeâ€™s pocket that is stolen by a thief while the husband is talking to her.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
What makes the game fun is that while the player chases the thief, he/she will encounter obstacles along the way that decrease the speed of the thief. If they manage to get the pocket, they can move to the next level, and the levels will get harder as they progress.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
The player chases the thief, who will change direction, and getting the pocket is the main goal.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?
The players will be absorbed by the game since it is challenging and requires focus. It will keep players engaged as the difficulty increases, demanding their full attention.
