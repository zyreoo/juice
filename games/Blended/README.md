**Game Name:** Blended
**Team Members:** Jam (James G)

**How would you describe your game in one line?**
A 2D roguelike metroidvania based off of hollow knight's mechanics where you play as different fruits and/or vegetables and your goal is to get to a blender to blend yourself into a delicious smoothie :D.

**What is the key mechanic(s) which make your game fun?**
The different abilities for different characters included in the combat system and their interactions with the environment and certain perks (*hopefully* the language barrier isnt too difficult to bypass using symbols :l)

**How does the game actually play (core gameplay loop)?**
The overall aim of the game is to add smoothie ingredients to a blender in order to in the end make your own smoothie (whatever combination of ingredients that may be). The player will face different types of enemies
and obstacles (platforming sections) as they progress through the kitchen in order to reach the *sacred* blender. They will be rewarded with items and weapons for completing challenges and will be faced with optional
but rewarding puzzles and secrets.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?**
I plan to keep players engaged by offering new routes through the kitchen with each playthrough along with a variety of abilities/perks for the different ingredients (each ability will have their own tutorial due to
the game being textless). I'll also create different items and weapons which boost stats and give unique perks (also explained using videos/symbols) to increase variety so the game doesn't become boring.
Finally, if I can figure it out, I'll try to use a procedurally generated level map for the kitchen stages to increase replayability and to discourage memorising the layout of the levels.

**More detailed explanation:**
You play through the game as different characters (ingredients) each with their own advantages/disadvantages who fight through ~3 stages each with a boss at the end of each stage guarding the blender.
During each stage, the player has opportunities to gain items and weapons which give different perks and (maybe) abilities to the player. These will provide the progression system needed in order for the player to be
properly prepared for the next stage and the boss (as they increase in difficulty). These items will reset with each run through the kitchen. If an ingredient dies, they cannot be played again in that playthrough and
therefore cannot be used in the smoothie :(. Before each playthrough, the route through the kitchen is selected which determines the stages the player will have to play through. After a route is won with an ingredient,
the stages used to win that route either become more dangerous or cannot be selected again (if already above a certain difficulty/heat).
