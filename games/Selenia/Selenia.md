**How would you pitch your game in one line?** Youâ€™re an astronaut who crash landed your spaceship on an unknown planet, you meet an alien buddy and must complete quests to repair your spaceship and go home!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The game will take place on an unknown planet that will encourage the player to explore new areas. While exploring these areas, the player will have to complete a wide variety of tasks that contribute to fixing the spaceship. In order to complete the primary objective, the player will also have to work past challenges such as windstorms while maintaining their food supply.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The player will have to solve progressively harder quests and puzzles in order to complete tasks and advance the storyline and fix the spaceship. These tasks could involve gathering materials, vehicle maintenance, and interacting with other characters in the story. The reward for the task will be becoming one step closer to fixing the spaceship and going home.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

We hope that the player will be motivated to fix the spaceship and complete the tasks, and we plan to incorporate a variety of tasks and environments to keep the player engaged. We will also design the storyline and visuals to be appealing and relaxing to play.
