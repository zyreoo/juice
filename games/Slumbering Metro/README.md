# Slumbering Metro

**Team Members:** Gil ("Gupo")

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Like [Tunic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/) mixed with [Metro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/) with a little bit of [The Exit 8](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2653790/The_Exit_8/).

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- "Memory Loss"/Map: The player can find ink to draw explored areas on their map, but areas they do not draw will change as soon as they aren't looking
- Puzzles & Exploration: Think Undertale, There Is No Game, Stanley Parable, etc.
- Atmoshpere: This won't be a "horror" game per se, but that doesn't mean there won't be a creepy atmosphere or a jumpscare or two.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will explore an abandoned and sprawling underground abandoned metro system, uncovering puzzles and the secrets of a long-forgotten civilization.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
As soon as the player enters the Metro, (because they didn't "draw" the exit) the exit will disappear and they will have to progress through the puzzles to find a way out. This simple task eventually complicates itself as the player finds more and more secrets, subplots, and sidequests.
