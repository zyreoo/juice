It is a metroidvania, RPG game where the charcter the character explores the world in an attempt to obtain an ancient artifect. What happens in the game would be determined on the players action, making it have different gameplay each time. The fun part is learning different ablities to counter and defeat your enemies.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The main character goal is to obtain an ancient artifect, different decisions can have different effects. For example, you can kill everyone that stands in your way, loot houses, be a town hero or even be pacifist. You can find weapons such as bows, crossbow, swords and axes in the wilderness or you can buy them from vendors. Killing enemies mostly won't grant you rewards but some would drop items, and for others you may be rewarded for killing a foe. You can learn abilities from visiting dojos where they would teach you a skill or you can hit the library and get a few books to learn it. There are differnt terrains in the game, some include towns, city and even forests.
