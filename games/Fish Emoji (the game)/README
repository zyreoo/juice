How would you pitch your game in one line? It's like Binding of Issac but with fish.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? 3 different fish with unique abilities where you can traverse into the depths of the mariana trench. The three fish have unique abilities and there are fun bosses.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) you start a room, clear enemies, and move on. Go until you die, start over.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? make them entranced in getting to the bottom of the ocean. gameplay is simple yet streamline.
