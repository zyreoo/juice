**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
This is a 2D side scroller level based game where the player setsan army of various units to defeat levels and make it to the end.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Various units can interact with enemies and each other in different ways: for example, a “tank” unit, something that takes a lot of damage, could protect “weaker” hoardes. By pairing or grouping complementing units, and gradually introducing new units over new levels, the player will be able to consider many varying ways for gameplay. Additionally, enemies under this setup can be of many different varieties, increasing uniqueness and length of play. The player sets the spawns of units at the beginning of each level, so they must be able to predict varying interactions.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
In a nutshell, the player attempts a level, and if completed, gains a reward such as a new unit (or maybe some currency) to expand their gameplay, then they do the next level. Various bosses on spaced out levels will be added for culminating challenges.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
We plan to add enough levels to allow the player to be engaged for 30 minutes or more. We hope this to be sufficiently repeatable for a 30m timespan.
