Dust and Dawn

Team Members: Esther, Peter, Layla

How would you pitch your game in one line? A soot sprite brings a dull world back to life

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? Platformer-ish game, level style.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) Adventure through the dust, completing levels and bringing light to dust. Make friends to help you with other levels, and collect accessories to decorate your sprite.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? Players should keep completing levels until they turn an entire dust area into dawn. One area could be about 30 ish minutes of play, several friends, and accessories. Other areas could be avalible, but also could be added later.
