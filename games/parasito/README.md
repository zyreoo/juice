#### Team Members: Sigfredo

#### How would you pitch your game in one line?
Think Hades but you play as a hive mind of parasites and when you die you wake up as a new parasite with new abilities

#### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
Different abilities each run. Possess creatures.

#### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
1. Pre-run: spawn as a new parasite. manage parasite colony
2. Dungeon-crawling: combat in randomly generated rooms with bosses between floors
3. Death: progression. each death is experience which can be used in the next run.  

#### How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Randomized maps and different abilites that can work for different play-styles
