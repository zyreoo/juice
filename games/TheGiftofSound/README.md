**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

A wordless, emotional journey in rediscovering the world through sound and music.


**What is the key mechanic that makes it fun?**

Players will use sound to harmonize with the environment and solve puzzles.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The core game loop will consist of the player navigating through distinct areas (eg. forests, villages, mechanical ruins) and following golden notes to discover hidden sounds.

The player will use sound and music to interact with the environment as well as solve puzzles. By collecting fragments of melodies the player will be able to unlock new paths or restore the area’s full soundscape.

The player will gradually piece together the character’s personal story


Challenges:

- Rhythmic or melodic puzzles where players must match or improvise melodies.

- Navigating areas with chaotic or dissonant sounds, requiring the player to calm the environment or focus to move forward.


Rewards:

- Unlocking the character's flashbacks.

- Restoration of the soundtracks and landscapes.


Scope:

3-5 distinct areas to explore to fulfil the 30 minute requirement.
