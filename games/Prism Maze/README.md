# Prism Maze

**Team Members:** Ethan John

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A platformer game meets a maze game.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player goes through different levels that combine a 3D maze and platformer with some levels requiring you to play a 2D "classic" style of the game. It will have some obstacles that can end their playthrough, where losing the game will put you back into the start with a new set of levels. This ensures each playthrough feels more like there's something on the line as you progress.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player faces a random set of levels with each either being a maze or a platformer stage. With each end of the level a player may randomly need to complete a classic level. At the end, the player will be rewarded with currency to style their character. (The game`s "classic" stlye mirrors my Sprig game "Up, Down, Top-down")

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game gets slightly more difficult as they go and ensuring each playthrough have different levels and challenges will allow replayability.

A playthrough may last less than 30 minutes based on the player, but with the different playthrough each time and a in-game currency to allow styling I aim to get the playtime higher. And an addition of a co-op mode may possibly increase the playtime even further. And each completion may also unlock new features for the player, encouraging multiple playthroughs.
