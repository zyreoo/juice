### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**
a 2D multiplayer game, where the player comes dresses up their character, weapons. Goes to fight with their freinds, fights the opponent, loot them if you can find their loot location, you'll get gold, weapons, and some other things..

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- Some 2D characters, they can enter into fight where they and their teammates will fight, but some will go find some locations where the opponent possibly has put their important weapons or hide their treasures.. 
- they can dress up their character, upgrade weapons, apply skins etc etc..
- they'll have to make their castle and other areas too, and also keep their loot somewhere safely, making sure the opponents can't find.
- Training

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- the player goes to fight in multiplayer or in training or in offline mode
- they gets the gold/weapons, if they can find it in oppo area
- wins/loses the fight, If you lose, you'll also lose your man power, efficiency, and if any one attacks you at this moment, you'll probably go out of resources and have to rebuild or get back these things from forest or some other place like trading something with someone..


### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- first the intro and the weapons training and all
- then, comes the first fight
- then, some party/sadness based on win/loss
- the story/game continuos based on the success or lose of the fight.
- and some things which I haven't thought of yet..
