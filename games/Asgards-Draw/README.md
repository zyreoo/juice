# Asgard's Draw

**Team Members:** Rishaan Desai and Maddy Plant

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

"It's like the Stardew Valley Mines meet Die in a Dungeon and Sokaban"

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]
The key mechanics are Sokoban-style puzzles, which which work together with Die in a Dungeon dice-style combat and Balatro-style combos. A top-down, character tracking camera would enable the addition of larger puzzles and a sense of exploration.

The second key mechanic are wombo-combo modifier cards on the side that effects every single turn you have during encounters (modifiers that let you do a lot more damage, heal a lot, abilities, etc.). 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
The player would make their way around levels, defeating enemies and bosses in progressively harder encounters and solving increasingly complex puzzles. Throughout this process, the player can collect new modifier cards (Circus Masters), that give them new abilities/modifiers that allow them to progressively build larger and larger combos througout the game.

Every some time, the player would face a boss, which would be a randomly chosen "god-like" character from a specific (to be determined, probably Norse) mythology.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Since we will have a pseudo-infinite (procedurally and varyingly repeating) series of multiple levels that the player would progress through, there is an a large number of scenarios that they would face (plus different encounters in every playthrough). Additionally, since we have a combo system, a player would feel engaged to continue building their skills and combos.
