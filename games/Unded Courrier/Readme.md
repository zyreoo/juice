# Undead Courier

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like a high-speed delivery game meets a zombie apocalypse, where you ride through a chaotic city dodging undead and upgrading your bike to survive!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The core mechanics would revolve around bike control where you navigate through a 2D city filled with zombies and obstacles. The player can steer, jump, and accelerate to avoid hazards while making quick deliveries. The upgrades could be focused on bike stats like speed, jump height, or zombie repellent gadgets. The fun comes from the challenge of tight maneuvering in a fast-paced environment while aiming for the best delivery times, with the added pressure of zombie hordes in your path!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
In Undead Courier, players navigate a 2D city on a bike, delivering packages while evading zombies and various obstacles. The objective is to finish deliveries swiftly, minimize damage, and enhance your bike for improved speed, handling, and durability. The game pushes players to find a balance between speed and caution, striving for high scores and extended survival in an increasingly chaotic setting.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, the game will offer a blend of increasing difficulty and rewarding upgrades. As players complete deliveries, theyâ€™ll unlock new areas, bike enhancements, and face tougher challenges (more zombies, harder obstacles). Short, action-packed levels with high replay value will motivate players to beat their previous times and improve their scores. The game will feature diverse environments (such as city streets, parks, or industrial zones) to maintain freshness, along with occasional special deliveries (like timed missions or challenging zombies to defeat) to introduce variety. The focus will be on ramping up the challenge and rewarding skillful play as players advance.
