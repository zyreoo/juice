# Junkpunk Rats

**Team Members:** Gleb G Godynskiy & Louis Wang

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its like Hollow Knight but mixed with a lot of "Junkyard" vibes, and also rats. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Good movement mechanics, creative enemies and bosses, lore told without the use of language, and like a lot of rats like an obscene amount like a comically large amount of rats. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Using similiar mechanics to hollow knight, the player will go room by room fighting enemies until they come up on an area boss which when defeated will introduce a new mechanic and start the loop from the start. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Mainly rats, but also a developing storyline and one by one introductions to different items and mechanics to keep the player experimenting, kind of like Ultrakill.
