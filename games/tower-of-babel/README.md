# Tower of Babel

**Team Members:** Sherry, Annie, Kieran, Eddie

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Hades meets Chants of Senaar: adventure your way up the now-ruined Tower of Babel by solving language-based puzzles, and unveil the hidden truths of the ancient Babylonians (and the fall of their society and tower...)

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Each floor in the Tower of Babel has intriguing linguistic puzzles that get increasingly complex. Also, NPCs will give cryptic hints that you also have to decode.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will enter a floor in the Tower of Babel, talk to NPCs, and decipher symbols using clues around the floor of the tower (each step will bring them closer to finding the truth, which will be fully revealed at the tower's topâ€¦)

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
As the player ascends the tower, puzzles will get more difficult, and new mechanics within it will get introduced every few levels. Lore surrounding the Tower of Babel will also be revealed as the game goes on.
