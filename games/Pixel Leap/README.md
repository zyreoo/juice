**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste, but with simpler graphics, a level-based system, and timers on each level! There will be a ton of content, with levels getting progressively harder!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
A lot of the key mechanics will be borrowed from Celeste - including the wall jumping, dashing, level harzards, etc. However, instead of a story, the game will be 100% languageless by having a purely level oriented design! There will be timers on each level, and a clear objective that has to be achieved in order to complete it (example, getting from Point A to B, or collecting every collectable)!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Each level will introduce something new (the initial ones will be focused on the movement abilities, then a number of enemies, and finally everything will be tied together in the final levels! The core challenge will be completing the level by achieving its objective, with the secondary challenge being beating your own personal best scores!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be a LOT of levels! Plus, I will ensure that each level is designed to be harder than the previous one! There will be an element of replayability by adding a personal best time on each level! I might add a lot of stuff later, but this is the general idea!
