# Leviathan

**Team Members:** jo9182


**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Keep going down. You don't have a choice.


**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The pressure gauge, the occasional shifts of gravity, and puzzles.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Going through the remanents from past expeditions of foreign civilizations. There will be puzzles and survival elements. Each civilization will have its own gameplay loop.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

After the small opening slides/cutscene, there will be an opening tutorial with instructions for movement followed by the pressure gauge tutorial before having the player descend to where the Mermaid lies. That section will play like a Metroidvania, including obscene amounts of backtracking. It should provide the player with at least 30 minutes of content
