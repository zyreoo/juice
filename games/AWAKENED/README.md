# AWAKENED

**How would you pitch your gane in one line?** 

An atmospheric, mysterious game centred around a hero resurrected again and again over time in order to defeat the evil plaguing the world.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

A focus on exploration and ability to reach and interact with new areas with an open movement system + combined with the existential theming of the game's plot.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The player will be able to move around on a vertical 2D map, and their goal is to defeat all the bosses in the world. They will spend a large portion of their time exploring, defeating small enemies, and unlocking abilities such as wall climbing, dashing and attacks. They will then be able to access new areas and find the bosses they must face.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

We will keep our players engaged through our twist, where once the player thinks they have beaten the game, it is revealed that they have been reawakened (hence the name of the game). They must then go through the whole world again, with their previous knowledge. However, in the time that the player was 'dead', the environement has changed and the player must face these new challenges with a completely new toolset.
