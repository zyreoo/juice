# Game Name: Journey to Eden

**Team Members:** Just me, Moses (Game Dev WildFlowers).

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a combination of games like New Super Mario Bros, No Man's Sky, Hollow Knight, and more importantly: Space Invaders.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic that makes it fun is the fast-paced action, combined with sometiems slower exploration. This will allow the player to feel rewarded based on how they spend their time exploring, resulting in an addictive flow between the two styles.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The core game loop is built into two "phases". The player explores the planets (levels), finds materials and then uses those materials to upgrade their ship. Then the second phase comes where in which they use their ship to both travel to more planets, and engage in intergalatic warfare (battles).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each planet (level) in the game will be dense and have much to explore, meaning it will take time to uncover everything on a planet. However, the player can leave a planet at (almost) any time, meaning that the average player will play for generally an extended period of time, because the game has so much player choice, without being overwhelming.
