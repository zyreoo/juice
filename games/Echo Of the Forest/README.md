# Echo of the Forest
**Team Members**: Vihaan Pingalkar, Shiv Singh

## Pitch:
It's a game where players must navigate a forest while avoiding an invisible devil, which can only be seen through sound-based echoes and Xrays.

## Key mechanics:
The main mechanic is using echoes to reveal parts of the environment and the position of the devil. Xrays amplify or distort the echoes, providing both advantages and challenges as players try to stay hidden.

## Core Game Loop:
Players explore the forest, utilizing sound to navigate and avoid the invisible devil. They must strategically use Xrays to reveal safe paths and the devil’s position while managing limited resources. The game progresses as players uncover more of the forest and attempt to find an exit, all while avoiding the devil.

## Engagement (30 minutes):
The game’s atmosphere and sound design create tension, with players needing to be constantly aware of the devil’s movements and manage their echoes. Players can experiment with different strategies to stay hidden and progress through different forest areas, with the challenge escalating as they go further.
