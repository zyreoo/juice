**Team Members:** Suyu Peng

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
it is a bomb diffusing game that players have to diffuse the bomb by cutting wires. the point i tho that the bomb's wireing is made with logic gates and one wrong press the bomb will go off on its own. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
it need you to think, you can practice your electrical engineering knowledge and it make you feel like you are an actual bomb diffuser in a swat team.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
the face different levels. the bomb in different level is different and the ifficulty is progressive. the player try to that in 5, 8, 12 minutes and there is a leaderboard for the player's best time in each level. the player would try to beat himself

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
as the player progresses, the levels will be challenging and the player can try to beat them selves in time.
