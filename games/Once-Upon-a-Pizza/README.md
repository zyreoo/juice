# Once Upon a Pizza

**Team Members:** Jiyeon Choo, Sol Jin

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Good Pizza, Great Pizza meets memory game but in a fairytale world."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Varying time limits for each order, taking notes of orders through icons (typed via 0-9), and cooking the pizza by dragging and dropping the ingredients.
Points based on the accuracy of the served pizza and time spent cooking decide the amount paid and whether the customers will leave special tips or not. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players receive orders in the form of shapes that mean certain ingredients for the pizza. 
They have to go through trial and error to guess the ingredients correctly. They also have to spend coins to refill the ingredients. 
A day works like a round, and a fixed number of customers visit the pizzeria each day. 
New customers are added each day, and the customers' orders become more difficult as days pass. 
The players are rewarded with gold coins and special tips from customers when their pizza meets the required accuracy points. 
The special tips are placed on the corner of the pizzeria like a trophy. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will loop back a day if the player's pizzeria has a negative revenue. 
The players have to maintain their pizzeria till day 7 (or longer) to have a normal ending, and collect all special tips to have a happy ending.
