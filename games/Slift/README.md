### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**
High tension horror game meets Stickman Swing.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** <br>
The main game mechanic is the method of movement. You have no legs, so must move entirely with your grapple thingies. You have two, which enable youo to not only move efficiently, but also creates even more opportunities for unique ways of moving (e.g, suspension, etc.). This also means that momentum is a vital resource in the game, and this enables interplay with the other main mechanic, staying in the shadows, undetected.

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** <br>
Players move through different areas in a kind of metroidvania inspired map, with vertical layers which can be progressed back and forth through. As they go, they can discover different 'components', which can be used to dynamically augment their swingy arms. They start at a surface level, where there is tons of sunlight everywhere, leading to a more reserved and slow playstyle. As they progress downwards, there is less and less light, but more danger is faced in the form of different enemies. Eventually, they reach the bottom and achieve some yet to be confirmed goal.

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** <br>
There are a few techniques we are using to engage players. The first of which is the dynamic upgrades. As players go deeper, different upgrades, uniquely tailored to specific playstyles can be unlocked. The second technique is the different areas, each of which with their own obstacles demanding a adaptation in playstyle. 
In terms of scope, we are aiming to produce 4-6 different areas, each with 5-10 minutes of content, depending on playstyle.
