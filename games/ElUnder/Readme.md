**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
It's an immersive game where you must reach the final elevator, mastering simple yet challenging tasks like in *Among Us*, while navigating through levels that may force you to backtrack if you make mistakes.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The fun lies in the exploration of diverse levels filled with intriguing tasks. Sometimes, an error leads you to an unexpected room, adding an element of surprise and strategy. You'll channel your inner detective, similar to an escape room experience. Combining tools to solve puzzles and clear levels adds depth and keeps the gameplay dynamic.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
To progress, you must complete various challenges and solve puzzles. Along the way, you'll uncover clues that either guide you to the exit or reveal the next task. Each level is a self-contained mystery, and your problem-solving skills are key. The game encourages trial and errorâ€”initial attempts might seem tough, but with persistence and critical thinking, you'll master the mechanics and advance.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
To sustain engagement:
- **Varied Tasks:** A mix of logic puzzles, pattern recognition, and memory-based challenges to keep things fresh.
- **Dynamic Levels:** Procedurally generated or uniquely designed rooms ensure no two playthroughs feel the same.
- **Backtracking Mechanics:** The possibility of opening the wrong door adds suspense and strategic depth.
- **Tool Combinations:** Players can experiment with different items to discover creative solutions.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** The game starts easy but gradually introduces complex tasks that test both reflexes and reasoning.

Our goal is to create a game that keeps players thinking, experimenting, and eager to see what the next level holds.
