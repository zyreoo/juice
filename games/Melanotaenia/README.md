**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste meets Doodle Hop but you have to worry about your colors

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The main mechanic is that the player will be able to change their color, by pressing certain buttons. They can only touch a certain platform if they are a certain color. The player will be going up and each level will increase in difficulty.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will be trying to solve and complete each level. They will face the challenge of the different puzzles of the different levels.  The player will feel rewarded by solving each level. While also feeling rewarded by advancing upwards.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will stage engaged by becoming more challenged with the increase of difficulty within each level. The game will start with a tutorial level where the player will be encouraged to fail. With the encouragement the player will learn the mechanics of the game.
