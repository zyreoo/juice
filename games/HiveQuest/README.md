# HiveQuest

**Team Members:** Charmunk, Colbster937, Arimo-o

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Stardew valley but instead of mainly focusing on crops you mainly focus on raising and farming bees, with a side focus on crops for the bees to pollinate and generate different types of honey 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You will be able to create your own honey farm, with many unqiue combos of flowers, crops, and species of bees to create the best possible honey and sell it to NPCs, with side aspects like growing crops and buying ingredients

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will have a small farm area to pick out plants to grow and buy plants, then they will go over to a beekeeping area and select which bees to go pollinate those crops, then they will be able to go to a market and sell honey and buy supplies

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
There will be many types of bees and honey to collect and sell, and there will also be quests from NPCs with different stuff they want from the player, as well as a few side features like growing crops and keeping a good reputation
