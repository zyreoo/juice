# Borg: 

**Team Members:** Sia Rathod & Sophia Duan

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"You are stranded on the planet “Borg” with your spaceship stolen, battle diverse cyborg enemies, steal their weapons, and grow strong enough to defeat the BOSS and reclaim your spaceship."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Kill the enemies (cyborgs) and get their weapons and build your skills to kill the boss. There are different kinds of cyborg with different weapons! The boss is immensely powerful and has a win streak of 3067204  but he is not impossible to defeat! Muahaha!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
After landing on the planet Borg, the player’s spaceship  is stolen by a giant cyborg! The player is too weak to fight back, so he slowly gains better weapons and skills by battling various other cyborgs that inhabit the planet. All building up to the final battle to reclaim his ship.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Enticing environment: The player can explore the alien planet, discovering its various secrets and inhabitants.
Diverse enemies: Each type of cyborg has their own feature, creating different fighting styles the player must react to. 
Skill based: Through trial and error, dying and respawning, the player learns different behaviours and attack patterns of the cyborgs.
