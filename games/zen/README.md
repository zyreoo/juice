**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A nature-based game where players interact with the environment to take care of nature - similar to many games where you take care of virtual pets/Tamagotchi

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Players control a character that interacts with nature in different ways like by cleaning up trash/pollution, planting trees, meditating, taking care of animals, etc. Actions have a positive/negative effect on the environment and the effect is shown through nature degradation and a well-being bar if not cared for.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Use arrows keys or WASD to walk around a 2d environment, press a key like E near objects to interact, a well-being bar at the bottom of screen that fills with positive actions and empties with negative actions. The game ends when the bar is fully restored. Challenges faced include pollution, climate crises, etc.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Zen will keep players engaged since the game will be relaxing yet informative and interactive and players will find it stress-relieving to care for nature with the peaceful game.
