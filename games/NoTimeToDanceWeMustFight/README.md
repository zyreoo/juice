# No Time To Dance, We Must Fight

**Team Members:** Joey, Julius, Juan, Jayson

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Imagine a video game. Now Imagine a fighting game. Now add some music. Okay, now you need to fight to the beat. Your combos change the progression of the music. Rhythm Fighting Game.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The video game we plan to make is a fighting game with music--at its core. Sync your moves and combos up with the beat to get bonus damage. Its a challenge but I think the need to perfectly time moves will make it so much more satisfying. This system also builds strategy right into the game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game will have online multiplayer which will add replayabiity. In addition, a short single-player progression is planned (without words, of course)

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
As mentioned before, local and online multiplayer will be more than enough to keep players engaged for 30 minutes. If a player is solo, our single-player mode (as mentioned before) will include bots to play against.
