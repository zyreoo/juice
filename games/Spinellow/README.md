**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's design is pretty similar to Pokemon and the attack system is inspered by octopath. With a unique twist of a scaling system.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanics that make the game fun are: the fact that you can level up and by doing so you can assign point to your fighter in order increase his or her stats,
the visitability of the map where you can find shops, alchemysts and much more,
the fight system that will be turn based and lastly that enemies will increase their strenghts on the basis of your level.
You will

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player is a fighter who at the beginning of the game will have 20 skill points to distribute based on his playing style. 
The fighter will have to go and face the boss of the arena at least once a day, otherwise he will be deranked.
The objective is to be able to defeat all the bosses, but to do so it will be necessary to improve from time to time to defeat increasingly stronger bosses,
until you become the best fighter in Spinellow City.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each time the player defeats a boss he will earn skill points, which he will use to improve himself and be able to defeat the next boss.
The game being strategic requires the player to use the options available to him in the best possible way. 
The combat being turn-based, gives the player 30 seconds to choose an action otherwise the boss will launch an attack again (it serves to make the game a little more frenetic).
Each boss has its own characteristics, with strengths and weaknesses and the player must try to implement the best strategy to emerge victorious from the arena.
