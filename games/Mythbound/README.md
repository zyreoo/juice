**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like *Ghostlore* meets *Hyper Light Drifter*, but with a survival twist and folklore-inspired shapeshifting.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- **Shapeshifting Combat:** Players can absorb and transform into mythical creatures, each with unique attacks and movement styles.  
- **Dynamic Environment Interaction:** Terrain, weather, and time of day influence gameplayâ€”some enemies are stronger at night, while certain pathways open only during storms.  
- **Survival Elements:** Players must manage stamina, hunger, and spirit energy, which fuels transformations and powerful abilities.  
- **Glyph Engraving System:** Customize abilities using a puzzle-like glyph system that alters attack combos and defensive moves.  

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. **Explore:** Traverse procedurally generated environments filled with supernatural dangers and hidden secrets.  
2. **Battle:** Engage in fast-paced combat using shapeshifting abilities and glyph-enhanced attacks.  
3. **Survive:** Manage limited resources while adapting to environmental changes.  
4. **Upgrade:** Absorb spirits, unlock new forms, and engrave glyphs to enhance abilities.  
5. **Progress:** Defeat powerful folklore-inspired bosses to gain access to new regions.
6. **Lore** Try to understand the lor of this world without any text actually in the game.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- **Varied Biomes & Enemy Behavior:** Each region introduces new environmental hazards and unique monster interactions.  
- **Challenging but Rewarding Progression:** Players gradually master transformations and unlock powerful combos.  
- **Exploration Incentives:** Hidden relics and mysterious landmarks provide upgrades and lore (conveyed visually).  
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Enemies become more aggressive based on player progression, preventing monotony.
