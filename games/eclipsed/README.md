**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like *Inside* meets *Light & Dark* but with a dynamic AI-driven enemy that hunts you in the light.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player must stay in the shadows to remain hidden from the enemy. The light exposes the player, making them vulnerable to being chased. This creates tension, as players must plan their movements carefully while reacting quickly to changing light sources. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player starts in a dark environment with some light sources, with the goal is to reach the exit of each level without being caught by enemies, which only detects them when they are exposed to light. The player can use static objects like crates or walls for cover and occasionally moving objects to create temporary safe zones. If the player gets caught in the light for too long, the enemy will chase them. If caught, the game restarts at the last checkpoint. Levels become more difficult over time.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will have progressively challenging levels, each introducing new obstacles like moving light sources or tighter spaces that make stealth more difficult. There will also be a timer-based escape mechanic, where in later levels, players have a limited time to reach the exit before the lights fully turn on, making the chase even more intense.
