How would you pitch your game in one line?
A fast-paced platform game where a pigeon falls out of a tree and has to avoid obstacles, fight
bosses, and finally, build a rocket in order to find its place in the skies

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? 
The variety of levels with unique hazards, bosses, and collectibles. Additionally, being able to
play this game as a small pigeon nativagting a big world provides the user with an atypical, 
interesting experience with new challenges to face.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) 
Players have to reach the end of a level, having avoided all of the obstacles/hazards and
defeated any bosses, to gain another piece of the rocket. The storyline progresses through
each level, building up more and more anticipation for the ending. Once the very last level
(level 5) is completed, the rocket will be built and the game will be won. 
Regular WASD (or arrow keys) + space bar + shift controls are used.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? 
The unique levels, collectibles, difficulty of the game, and anticipation created throughout the
storyline progression, will keep players engaged. The difficulty of the game will increase as
the levels go on, but there will be checkpoints to balance out the difficulty of getting through 
the latter levels. There will only be five levels.
