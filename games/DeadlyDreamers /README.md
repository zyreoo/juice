Game Name: Deadly Dreamers
Team Members: Anya, Rylee

How would you pitch your game in one line?
"It's like Downwell meets Limbo, but with a surreal dreamworld where you’re endlessly falling to escape the nightmare."

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
Endless Falling: The player is always in motion, creating a fast-paced survival challenge.
Dodge & Collect: Players must avoid obstacles (ghostly hands, spikes, shifting walls) while collecting orbs to maintain "lucidity."
Dynamic Difficulty: The game gets progressively harder as the dream world distorts, speeds up, and introduces trickier obstacles.
Simple Controls: Left/right movement (keyboard, touch, or tilt for mobile) makes it accessible but skill-based.
How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
Start Falling: The player automatically descends through a dream world.
Dodge & Navigate: Avoid obstacles that appear randomly or move unpredictably.
Collect Orbs: Gather orbs to keep the lucidity meter from draining.
Escalating Challenge: The longer you survive, the faster the fall and the more chaotic the environment becomes.
Game Over: If you run out of lucidity or hit too many obstacles, you wake up, ending the run.
Scoring & Replayability: Your final score is based on survival time and orbs collected, encouraging multiple attempts.
How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?
Increasing Difficulty: The game’s speed and hazards keep ramping up, making each run more intense.
High Score Challenge: Players will want to beat their best survival time and orb count.
Varied Environments: Different dream layers (visual changes, new obstacles) keep it fresh.
Power-Ups: Temporary shields, slow-motion effects, or boosts could add variety.
