**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Doodle Champion Island Games meets Super Mario but with a time travel twist and a dimensional journey."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The core mechanic revolves around solving mini-games and puzzles to collect missing parts of a malfunctioning time machine. 
Each mini-game challenges the player’s logic, timing, or pattern recognition skills, offering a variety of gameplay to keep things fresh and engaging.
The mechanic is fun because it’s fast-paced, with immediate rewards for successful challenges that help the player progress.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players control a character who’s been transported to an alternate dimension after their time machine malfunctioned.
The objective is to explore different areas, engage in mini-games, and collect the machine's missing parts.
Players are constantly leveling up by completing challenges and advancing through levels.
The challenges range from platforming sections to puzzle-solving, each unlocking new areas or providing the necessary components to fix the time machine.
There’s a constant sense of progression as players face new obstacles and gain new skills to overcome them.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, the game will offer a series of short, fun challenges that progressively increase in difficulty.
Each mini-game will have a set of objectives that the player must complete before moving on to the next. 
To prevent repetitiveness, there will be different types of mini-games (platformer, logic puzzles, reflex-based tasks) and unlockable content as players progress. 
The game's core loop will focus on exploration, problem-solving, and reward systems to keep players motivated and entertained.
