**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"Its like we create an analogy and connect it to gamers doing circuits from easy to hard levels."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Like some Maths questions which when solved are very beautiful, similarly our game have circuits which when solved will be so beautiful

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players will go into an analogy where they need to solve circuits and can go to the next levels. The circuits include putting resistor values and capacitor values.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Gamer will navigate through various electrical circuit paths, keeps calculating the relavent resistor and capacitor values thus switching on the loads like LED, DC motor, etc
