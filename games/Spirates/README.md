**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Lethal Company combined with No Man's Sky, with short eventful coop missions that take place across space.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Players will have to manage 3 resources - Fuel, Oxygen, and Time - in order to complete missions delivering resources from one planet to another across the galaxy. 
All 3 resources can in some way be traded for another, for example: You could slingshot around a black hole to gain speed if you don't have enough fuel, but in the process
end up losing a lot of time due to time dilation. Another example would be trading oxygen for fuel, where you could burn your oxygen supply to give your ship a speed boost,
allowing you and your crew to reach your destination before the mission expires.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players would be outlaws smuggling things like alien eggs across the galaxy, and would have to face random encounters on their journeys, such as dealing with space police
or an unexpected asteroid belt. At the same time, the players must manage their 3 resources effectively, in order to complete their mission. Each mission would be roughly 15-30 minutes
long, and the players would earn credits they can use to upgrade their ship or gain accessories.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Through being able to upgrade your ship and go on harder missions for higher rewards, the game will be engaging, encouraging players to continue playing to upgrade the spaceship to the
max, and be able to experience all the random encounters. As well as this, the game being coop would allow for the players to have fun with friends while completing these missions,
which always makes a game more engaging.
