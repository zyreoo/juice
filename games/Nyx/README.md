# Nyx: The Stray Lightkeeper

**Team Members:** Shohruh

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A stray cat parkours through a city, fights shadow monsters and turns the lights back on before everything goes dark.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game combines fast-paced parkour, light-based combat, and puzzle-solving. Nyx can switch between two realities to find hidden paths, escape danger, and solve puzzles. 
The enemies are weak to light, so Nyx must use streetlights, reflections, and creative tricks to fight them off. Meanwhile, lights constantly go out, forcing Nyx to stay on the move.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Nyx runs through the city, searching for broken lights while avoiding or battling shadow creatures. The shadows attack and turn off more lights, making the world darker and more dangerous. 
Nyx fights back using light and her agility, solving small environmental puzzles to restore power. As the game progresses, the enemies get stronger, the puzzles get harder, and the city falls into deeper darkness. 
If Nyx doesn’t move fast enough, the city is lost.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game has five levels, each getting harder. Enemies become stronger, puzzles more complex, and the city’s lights go out faster. Nyx must keep up or risk total darkness. 
In the final level, everything moves at full speed—if Nyx restores enough lights, she saves the city. If not, the shadows win, and the city is lost.
