# Flea

**Team Members:** Summer Guo

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
If Crossy Road was the journey of a Flea.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Like Crossy Road, the player controls a character (Flea) and jumps from platform to platform. Unlike Crossy Road, the platforms are the heads of humans. I believe enough has been said.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players try to get high scores while surviving. The idea is that the different heads will have varying degrees of hygiene, and the player should try to jump the Flea onto dirty hair. If jumping onto a clean head of hair, the existing health bar of the Flea will be hurt depending on the duration passed while on clean hair. To move, players will use drag and release, not taps. There will be a global leaderboard, to promote competition.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
I am hoping that what drives people to play Temple Run, Crossy Road, and Subway Surfers for incredible lengths of time will keep players interested in this game.
