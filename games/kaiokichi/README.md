## **How would you pitch your game in one line?**
“It's like Dragon Ball meets Smash Bros but with a story revolving around YOU, the player!"

## **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Taking elements from both Super Smash Bros. and classic fighting game mechanics, the gameplay allows for interesting combinations of attack chains.
The game utilizes quarter circles, introducing a challenging mechanic for beginner players to learn and have fun with. Different inputs from the controller
dictate what move they use -- they can use heavy, medium, and light attacks, as well as deflect/counter incoming attacks from an opponent.
To limit the player, there is a stamina gauge and a special gauge to prevent spamming and encourage players to chain combos with different attacks.
As you win battles, you gain more EXP and level up, making yourself stronger with each victory.

## **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Your goal is to be the number one martial artist and win the world tournament! You face challenging foes along the way and meet new friends to
learn new abilities and fight alongside. Once the player reaches the tournament after their perilous journey from their home, they’re ready to fight
the bosses! When they finally win after many fights, they are crowned the World Champion and the greatest fighter around!

## **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
This game is made for those who enjoy a Street Fighter/Smash Bros. type of video game. Players can enjoy many challenges, ranging from easy
pickings to challenging adversaries. The player will bond with the characters in the game, face trials that will require them to focus and approach situations
with strategy, and bear many defeats on the way to becoming the best… But will feel rewarded once they finally achieve their goal!!!
