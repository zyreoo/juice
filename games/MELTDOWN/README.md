**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

stuck in a snowstorm, bash and dash your way through enemies before frostbite kicks in.


**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

time constantly ticks down, and is your only lifeline.

big linear level, branching paths that you learn about over attempts.

smooth, fast top-down movement, yet its hard to master.

combat is indirect, rather you must get environment kills.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

kill enemies = more time, get to the end.
in order to kill enemies, you must maneuver enemies and/or objects into each other to create chain reactions, or just to chuck a table at some dude. 
later parts of the level will incorporate traps and more efficient killing methods that you can then apply to earlier sections to further increase your speed.
intermittently within the level, breather rooms will offer various items to improve your run.

your ultimate goal is complete memorization of the level, and how to kill everyone as fast as possible. a true speedrunner's dream.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

one big long level. the permadeath element combined with the knowledge of shortcuts will keep people feeling like they have made progress.
