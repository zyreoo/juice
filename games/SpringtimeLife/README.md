**Team Members:** Neha 

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It is like Subway Surfers, but you are a fairy collecting fairy stuff and dodging bad elves.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You get to choose your fairy(male/female) and dress it up! 
At the start of the game, you choose a map. The fairy must collect fruits,crystals and fairy dust within a given time limit while also keeping itself safe from goblins and trolls. Fairies can also weaken goblins and make them harmless(because fairies are good, they don't kill).
The level will be restated if you fail to collect enough goodies.
If you successfully pass, you level up, and unlock new maps, new outfits for your fairies and better abilities!!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Each level is set for a particular time limit. You can change your character's position using up/down keys. Change speed using the right/left keys. You also have an on-screen analog stick. You can use various attacks to weaken goblins. And use boosters in the game to increase speed. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each level runs for about 3-5 minutes. There will be various levels to conquer and a few maps. After each level, you can unlock new
outfits, and abilities for your fairy so that you can use these in the next level.
