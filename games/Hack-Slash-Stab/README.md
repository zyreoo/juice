**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You are a puny flying dagger bouncing through level to defeat hordes monsters while crashing into powerups to create large damage combos.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
There are 4 main mechanics
1. Speed    --- You have limited speed, which once it runs out, your run is done.
2. Powerups --- Powerup orbs spawn throughout the map, and can do many things, like increase your speedometer, slow time down, drag swords into black hole, and create new swords
3. Combos   --- You hit combos through multiple swords hitting one enemy. Damage numbers are directly added to your score.
4. Upgrades --- At the end of a run, you can upgrade certain stats to have even longer, or more hectic runs.

Each of these mechanics should keep the player engaged for multiple runs, trying to beat their last previous high score.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You start off a run in the center of the arena. You give yourself an initial direction with left or right click, and at that moment, monsters start spawning from the earth. Powerup orbs also start to spawn. As you have more daggers, the screen will get more hectic, but you are more likely to damage more monsters, and also cause more combos. Combos multiply your score. Then, the game follows a typical survivors like game loop. At the end of a run, when you finally run out of speed, you get taken to a game over screen, where you can boost stats or start a new run.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Combo's, upgrades, and the high score system should keep the game replayable, like a survivors-like, but with shorter runs. Big boss enemies should also keep the game interesting, especially as a bigger hitbox means more chance to combo.
