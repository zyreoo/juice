How would you pitch your game in one line?
*Core Concept:*
A death game where each room is a deadly trap that impacts the player’s health. The player wears a shock collar on their neck and wrists, preventing them from speaking—any sound results in an instant shock.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? 
To maintain player engagement, the game incorporates a dynamic balance of challenging puzzles and strategic turn-based combat, ensuring a compelling and immersive experience throughout the journey.

How does the game actually play?
*Gameplay Progression:*
-Opening Sequence (First 5-7 Minutes):
*The player navigates through trap-filled rooms, dodging dangers (similar to Deltarune’s mechanics, but with additional trap variety).
*After some time, they find a vent and attempt to crawl through it.
A loose plate gives way, causing them to fall.
*Screen cuts to black.

-Meeting "2" (Next 10 Minutes):
*The player wakes up to another person ("2") shaking them awake.
*"2" has bandaged the player’s wounds, (already making them likable).
*A short cutscene plays- uk- showing that the mc fell down, woke up and stuff.

-Puzzle Progression (u can decide the Minutes):
*They solve puzzles together now- same mechanics just harder with each room (lets say theres like 5 rooms)
*Each room autosaves after completion.
*Throughout the rooms, player choices impact trust—these will influence the ending.

-Final Room – The Ultimate Test:
*The two enter an empty room with only a table and a gun.
*Searching the room confirms this is the final test.
*Only one can leave.
-Three Possible Endings:
*The player grabs the gun- a mini fight sequence
*The player offers to die- if you built enough trust
*Neither acts, leading to a standoff or starvation OR theres a timer and they both die

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
its on the upper passage

(-Optional minigame (if we got time):
-In one of the rooms, "2" sees a corpse and panics.
-The player must complete a simple minigame to calm themselves first.
-If successful, they can attempt to calm "2" down.
-Failing this minigame will impact the ending.
-Minigame idea: Heartbeat timing mechanic (like a mini rhythm game))
