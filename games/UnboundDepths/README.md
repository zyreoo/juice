**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
An underwater roguelike where you explore abandoned bases for parts

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Swappable parts, puzzle mechanics involving enemies, and general upgrades to the player's character and base.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player starts in an underwater base, and they can interact with various sensors or components inside the base. They can go to abandoned bases and loot these bases for more “components” that they can attach to their character, with a limited amount of slots where these could be attached. These components will be essentially player upgrades/perks, increasing the player's stats, speed, or letting the player see nearby enemies or extra components, etc. 

These abandoned bases will be dangerous and may require the user to shut off portions of them to avoid the whole base collapsing, or to section off monsters(?) in the bases. The player will have to manoeuvre through these bases to the best of their ability without getting attacked, or if it feels right we may add combat.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
We will try to make the gameplay reasonably fast-paced so that the player stays engaged. The parts they will find will add some change to the game, and hopefully make it reasonably replayable. We will make these bases that the player loots procedurally generated, with content that should create a decent amount of diversity between them, and increase the difficulty as the player goes on.
