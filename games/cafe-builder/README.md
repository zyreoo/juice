# cafe-builder

**Team Members:** Charlotte Woodrum

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its a zen cafe builder meets tower defense where you have 5 minutes serve your customers and then a designated defense preparation period before you get attacked by waves of cats. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The variation between zen cafe and tower defense is both fun and engaging and makes sure the player doesn't get bored--see pitch for what should happen. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
On one side, players build their dream cafe through arranging furniture and customizing the overall appearence of their cafe. Then, they must defend it from evil cat monster things (challenge). When they survive the wave, they gain currency which allows them to further customize and upgrade their cafe--but, they have to make sure to also spend some of it defending for the next wave, otherwise they may lose their cafe! 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
By increasing the difficulty of the waves as time goes on, and with an engaging market system which has users anticipating purchases and saving up. General scope: defend your cafe. There will probably be a final wave at around wave 50 or smth with a big boss.
