### How would you pitch your game in one line?
Experience cricket like never before in a surreal, zero-gravity cosmic arena where gravity wells, black holes, cosmic winds and physics-based chaos redefine the game!

### What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?

1. **Zero-Gravity Physics**: The ball floats and moves unpredictably, creating unique challenges and opportunities. Players must adapt to the ball’s trajectory, which is influenced by gravity wells, black holes, and cosmic winds.
2. **Dynamic Arenas**: Each arena has its own hazards (e.g., asteroid fields, wormholes) and interactive elements (e.g., gravity wells, collapsing stars), making every match feel fresh and exciting.
3. **Creative Batting and Bowling**:
     - **Batting**: Players can charge up their swing for powerful shots or angle their bat to control the ball’s direction.
     - **Bowling**: Players can curve the ball’s path mid-air using gravitational slingshots or cosmic winds, adding a layer of strategy.
4. **Power-Ups**: Collect cosmic energy to unlock special abilities like ***Super Strike*** (hit the ball harder), ***Gravity Shield*** (protect your wicket), and ***Time Slow*** (slow down time for precision shots).
5. **Multiplayer Modes**:  Compete against friends in 1v1 matches or team up in co-op challenges, ensuring endless replayability.

### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

1. **Start Match**: Players choose a cosmic arena and mode (single-player, multiplayer, or co-op).

2. **Batting**: Use intuitive controls to hit the ball into cosmic targets (e.g., glowing rings, planets) to score runs. Adjust your swing angle and power to control the ball’s trajectory.

3. **Bowling**: Aim and curve the ball using gravitational slingshots or cosmic winds to outsmart the batter.

4. **Hazards and Power-Ups**: Navigate dynamic hazards (e.g., black holes, asteroids) and collect power-ups to gain an edge.

5. **Win Condition**: Score more runs than your opponent or complete challenges (e.g., hit a certain number of targets) to win.
