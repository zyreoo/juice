## **How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like *Tetris* meets *Stealth Puzzle*, but with bouncing light beams and shifting shadows."  

## **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
Players manipulate **light beams** by placing and rotating mirrors, prisms, and reflectors to **illuminate targets** while avoiding shadowed areas. Shadows **move dynamically**, blocking paths or revealing hidden objects.  

## **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Players start with a **light source** and use mirrors to **redirect beams** toward targets. Shadows shift as objects move, creating **new challenges**. Some objects **activate or break** when hit by light, adding **puzzle-solving elements**. The goal is to **light up all targets** using limited moves.  

## **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**  
- **Escalating difficulty**: More mirrors, multiple light sources, moving obstacles.  
- **Unlockable mechanics**: Splitters (divide beams), color filters, time-based challenges.  
- **Puzzle variety**: Timed levels, hidden collectibles, shadow-based mazes.
