### How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

Character Creation & Story Introduction:
Choose your Radiant Order, each with unique, visually represented abilities that define your combat and exploration style.

Exploration & Visual Decision-Making:
Navigate through key locations in Roshar (like the Shattered Plains or Urithiru), interact with NPCs through visual prompts, and make choices that align with your Radiant’s Oaths and allegiances.

Combat:
Engage in grid-based tactical battles, leveraging your Radiant’s powers and strategic movement to overcome adversaries. Abilities are visually distinct, making combat engaging and accessible.

Progression:
Level up, unlock new visually represented abilities, and deepen your connection with your spren, influencing future battles and story developments.

Repeat:
Each encounter and decision visually alters your journey, leading to new challenges, allies, and enemies.
### How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

Immediate Engagement: Start with an exciting story hook and quick, easy-to-learn combat that lets players experience the thrill of Radiant powers right away. Each battle has clear objectives, and the stakes in the narrative choices feel significant.
Short-term Engagement: Players can dive into combat scenarios, which will only take 10-15 minutes but will be rewarding due to strategic decision-making and unique Radiant abilities.
Narrative Progression: Even within the 30-minute window, the player will experience meaningful character progression, unlocking new abilities, encountering unique characters, and influencing the story with their Oaths and choices.
**Scope:** The initial game will feature:Initial Launch: Focused on a single story chapter with a limited set of Radiant Orders (perhaps Windrunners, Skybreakers, and Dustbringers) and a handful of combat scenarios. The world will be rich but not overwhelming, allowing for deeper engagement as players grow more attached to the characters and lore.
Expansion: Post-launch, add new Radiant Orders, additional levels, and branching narrative paths. Future multiplayer modes could involve players choosing different Radiants and working together in co-op battles or competing against each other.

Expansion plans include a multiplayer mode and additional levels post-launch!
