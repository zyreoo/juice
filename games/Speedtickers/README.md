*How would you pitch your game in one line?*
[A 2d Plataformer based in the ULTRAKILL frenetic movement and the mechanics of Celeste requiring to beat levels before the time runs out.]

*What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?*
[The movement will be the main key mechanic of the game, the player will contain the following capabilites:]
[- Dashing abilities(In all 8 directions), the dash will contain the ability to skip certain blocks]
[- FAST and FRENETIC movement, similar to ULTRAKILL while being based in the momentum from Celeste]
[- Along with being able to dash, the player can also SLIDE in the ground and make a fast movement, but only in one direction, the SLIDING capability can be used to skip enemies]
[- The player will have to ability to CROUCH and that will reduce all movement made by the player, so if you dash and crouch at the same time, the dash effect will be lower]

*How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)*
The idea is for the Player to get to an objective in short yet difficult levels that challenge mostly the use of the player movement, requiring mastering of it.
The game will contain 3 worlds with 5 levels each(totalling 15 levels). The Player will have to pass the level before an in-game timer runs out

[The game will contain, enemies that when the players touches them dies, Blocks that require special dashing abilities, and many more obstacles that require learning abilities to beat.]

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[While the game WILL NOT contain a lot of levels, they will be challenging enought to require repetition and the MASTERING of the movement abilites]
[Most of the replayability of the game will be based in mastering the mechanics and beating the game in the LEAST time possible, similar to Cuphead with the expert mode]
