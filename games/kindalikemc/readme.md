# 2D Building Adventure

**Team Members:** Ethan

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Terraria meets Minecraft 2D but with a focus on  generated structures and dynamic terrain shaping.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- **Dynamic Building System**: Players can place and break blocks of different materials (dirt, stone, grass, wood, leaves, water, sand) to create their own structures or modify the  generated world.
- **Procedural Generation**: The world features naturally generated terrain with trees, houses, and varying heights using noise algorithms for a unique experience each time.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Players can jump and navigate the terrain with gravity mechanics, making exploration and building challenging and engaging.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. **Explore**: Players traverse a procedurally generated 2D world with varying terrain, discovering different biomes and structures
2. **Gather**: Break blocks to collect different materials
3. **Build**: Use collected materials to construct buildings, modify terrain, or create custom structures
4. **Progress**: Discover new areas, find rare materials, and expand their construction capabilities
5. **Repeat**: Continue exploring further, gathering more resources, and building bigger structures

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**
- **Progressive World Generation**: New chunks of the world are generated as players explore, ensuring there's always something new to discover
- **Multiple Building Materials**: Different block types (dirt, stone, grass, wood, leaves, water, sand) allow for creative construction possibilities
- **Structure Discovery**: Randomly generated structures like trees and houses provide points of interest and inspiration for building
- **Future Expansion Potential**:
  - Add crafting system for creating new block types
  - Implement hostile entities for survival elements
  - Add underground cave systems
  - Include weather systems affecting gameplay
  - Add multiplayer functionality for collaborative building
