**Team Members:** Solo probably, @Elaralia on slack

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste meets an art studio, restoring a fading world through the power of colour. But probably not as good. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Colour based actions, certain colours allow certain abilities, you transfer the coulors around to restore them to the world, and to yourself on the inside. You can only carry one colour at a time, you need to manage how you will get through the level with that colour first

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The colours of the world are fading, life is being sucked out of it and it begins to feel meaningless. The player starts in a drab, expressionless world, a world which feels repetetive and pointless.
The player stumbles upon a colour shard, and restores some colour to the world within that level. They progress through more levels, finding more colours and restoring what seems to have been lost to the world.

It is a 2d platformer, 8 bit style. Each level has obstacles and puzzles, with more colours and powers being introduced.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Through adding new powers, new puzzles. Because I plan to keep adding int4eresting abilities and curveballs, hopefully it will be engaging. Also, I hope the message of the game inspires gameplay, the player wants to play so they can heal this broken world they have stumbled upon, and restore life to it
