**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
An isometric real-time dungeon crawler with sorcery, in which a party of nautical adventurers delve into the depths of deep-sea trenches to find a lost ship carrying lots of injured people who are running out of air in the isolated cabins.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player would need to finish the game under a fix amount of time (as everyone on the ship is slowly dying of asphyxiation). This is most certainly a "core mechanic", but it isn't exactly a fun one. The one gameplay mechanic that may be considered entertaining by most, is the fact that the player can switch between which character he wants to actively control from the party. While one character is being controlled, the others repeat a simple order indicated. This makes playing multiple characters at once easier.
Since the game is played in an underwater setting, the player has to mind the party's oxygen supply. Some rooms serve as oxygen-refill spots for the player.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The party enters a deep sea cavern (functionally a dungeon room) that has enemies inside, which have to be defeated in order to progress further. Some caves contain treasure or equipment from shipwrecks, which rewards the player for their struggles. Each cave is procedurally generated, and they get progressively harder. There will be a fixed number of dungeons that the player has to beat in order for them to finish a run.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The game will be a real hell in the water, making the player focus continuously in order for them to win. Quick reaction time and a sense of strategy is essential.
