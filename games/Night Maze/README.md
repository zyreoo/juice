# Night Maze: An Open Source Survival game

**Team Members:** Tony Deng

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Five Nights at Freddy's, but you as the player can move, plus the AI for the enemies is much smarter.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
In Five Nights at Freddy's, you can use the camera system to monitor the enemy and take actions based on that to avoid being killed.
But unlike Five Nights at Freddy's, this "action" includes moving across rooms to avoid enemies, which makes it more fun.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You are in a closed building with multiple rooms connected to each other, and you have the ability to move around in them.
There will be enemies trying to kill you by coming around the room searching for you, and they can even communicate with each other to make the search more efficient.
You try your best to survive in a certain period of time by monitoring the enemies with a camera system and try your best to avoid them.
More mechanics like fighting with the enemies, closing doors to slow down the enemies, picking up items for your advantage, or other interesting mechanics I brainstormed in the future can be added if I have spare time.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
With action-packed gameplay and smart enemies that adapt and work together, players move through rooms to escape, using strategy and a camera system to survive. 
Each playthrough feels different, with rewards for progress and the chance to explore and discover secrets. 
The mix of suspense, strategy, and fresh challenges makes it exciting and fun to keep playing.
