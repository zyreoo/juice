## How would you pitch your game in one line?
It's like Minecraft Dungeons meets Hades, but with a unique time-rewind mechanic that gives players a second chance in intense combat.
## What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
- Time Rewind Ability: 
Players have a limited-use ability to rewind seconds of gameplay, 
allowing them to dodge fatal attacks, retry a missed combo, or escape a tough situation. 
This creates a thrilling risk-reward dynamic where players must strategically decide when to use their time rewind, 
adding a layer of tactical depth to fast-paced combat.
- Procedural Dungeon Generation: 
Each run generates a unique dungeon layout, 
ensuring no two playthroughs are exactly the same. 
Randomized room designs, enemy placements, and loot distributions keep the experience fresh and unpredictable, 
encouraging multiple runs and exploration.
- Loot-Based Progression: 
Players collect increasingly powerful weapons and armor with unique properties. 
The equipment system allows for diverse playstyles, with gear that can dramatically change combat approaches â€“ 
from lightning-fast daggers to powerful area-of-effect magical weapons.
## How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
1. Players enter a procedurally generated dungeon with a specific equipment loadout.
2. Navigate through randomized rooms, battling various enemy types and avoiding traps.
3. Collect loot, upgrade equipment, and strategically use the time rewind ability during challenging encounters.
4. Defeat progressively difficult enemies and mini-bosses, each room presenting new tactical challenges.
5. Reach the final boss of the dungeon, using all acquired skills and equipment to overcome the ultimate challenge.
6. Complete the run, unlock new equipment or abilities, and prepare for the next randomized adventure.
## How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
- Varied Combat Encounters: Different enemy types with unique attack patterns that require strategic thinking and skillful use of the time rewind mechanic.
- Continuous Progression: A robust loot system that constantly provides new and exciting equipment, motivating players to explore and experiment.
- Increasing Difficulty: Dungeons that scale in complexity and challenge, ensuring that players are always tested and improving their skills.
- Replayability: Procedural generation and the time rewind mechanic ensure that each run feels unique and exciting.
- Short, Intense Runs: Design philosophy focused on 20-30 minute dungeon experiences that are perfect for quick play sessions while still providing a sense of accomplishment and progression.
