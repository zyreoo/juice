## Bipolar

**Team Members**: Rania

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Help a young girl come to terms with her father’s death by uncovering memories and navigating between the manic and depressive worlds of her mind. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The world shifts and different memory fragments lie in different worlds. While the main focus is visual storytelling, the player is able to collect and piece these memories together through simple puzzles. However, as in real life, it can be unpredictable if a memory will be beneficial or not.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- Players explore the 2 worlds - manic and depressive, which change randomly, to find fragments of memories (setting - childhood home)
- They collect and explore fragments of memories which helps them uncover the story behind their relationship
- They’re trying to achieve emotional healing via memory reconstruction.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- New areas open up as more memories are uncovered and sub-tasks completed.
- The story gets more interesting as some memories are shown to be conflicting and we’re forced to pick and choose.
