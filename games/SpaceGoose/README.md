# Space Goose

**Team Members:** Paya Maroufi, Harry Liu, William Wen, Poshkin Omer

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Mario but with Geese in space, including RNG elements (definitely not gambling ðŸ˜…) and the ability to upgrade your character into different types of geese!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You can progress your goose throughout the world, growing and learning, until you reach the final goose form!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
It's a platformer, similar to Mario. The players are trying to progress their goose enough to beat the final boss. Unlike Mario, there is no singular linear progression, however, they need a certain amount of XP to enter each level.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
They must upgrade their goose all the way in order to beat the final boss, which will take at least 30 minutes. We will also provide sufficient, non-repetitive content to support players in leveling up.
