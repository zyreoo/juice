### How would you pitch your game in one line?
It's like an escape room game where players are trapped in a location and must complete various levels to break free.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanics that make the game fun are the balance between resource management and task completion. Players earn points by overcoming challenges and solving puzzles, which adds a sense of achievement. These points can then be spent on essential resources like food, water, and health, creating a strategic layer where players must decide how to manage their survival while advancing through the game. The combination of action, strategy, and progression keeps the gameplay engaging and dynamic.

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**:
The core game loop involves the player navigating through different rooms or environments, solving puzzles, and overcoming challenges like monsters. As they progress, they earn points that can be used to buy essential resources such as food, water, and health. The ultimate goal is to escape the room and return to the real world, but players must manage their survival while facing obstacles and completing tasks.

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, the game will progressively increase in difficulty as players advance through levels, offering a sense of challenge and achievement. Players will solve puzzles, find clues, and overcome obstacles to escape the rooms, earning points along the way. These points allow them to purchase essential supplies like food, water, and health, which adds an element of strategy and resource management. As the levels get harder, new types of challenges, monsters, or puzzles will be introduced, keeping the gameplay fresh and dynamic. The scope of the game will evolve as players continue, with new environments and mechanics added to maintain interest and provide a sense of progression.
