# Echoes of Elsewhere

**Team Members:** [Kishan Joshi]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[It's like Gorogoa meets Celeste but with parallel worlds and hidden paths that evolve as you progress.]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Parallel Worlds: Players can switch between two (or more) versions of the same level, each with unique environmental states and obstacles. This mechanic encourages creative problem-solving and exploration, as players must use the differences between worlds to progress.
Hidden Paths and Secrets: Levels are designed with multiple routes, including secret paths that reward curiosity and experimentation. These paths often lead to collectibles, shortcuts, or entirely new areas, adding depth and replayability.
Evolving Mechanics: New mechanics are introduced gradually, such as time manipulation, environmental interaction, and character abilities, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Objective: Reach the end of each level to progress toward a distant, mysterious destination (e.g., a glowing tower).
Exploration: Players navigate intricately designed levels, searching for the main path while uncovering hidden routes and secrets.
Puzzle-Solving: Players use parallel worlds, environmental interactions, and evolving mechanics to overcome obstacles and solve puzzles.
Progression: Completing a level unlocks the next, but discovering secrets and hidden paths can unlock bonus levels, collectibles, or alternate routes.
Rewards: Players are rewarded with new mechanics, story revelations, and visual transformations of the world, creating a sense of accomplishment and discovery.]

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[Engagement: The game keeps players engaged through a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and discovery. Each level introduces new mechanics or twists on existing ones, ensuring the gameplay stays fresh. Hidden paths and secrets encourage replayability, while the evolving narrative and world design create a sense of progression and mystery.
Scope: The game is divided into themed chapters, each with 5-7 levels. A 30-minute play session could cover 2-3 levels, introducing new mechanics and revealing parts of the overarching story. The scope is manageable but allows for expansion with additional chapters, mechanics, and secrets.]
