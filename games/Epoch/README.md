**Team Members:** The Grass (alone)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A puzzle platformer based on returning to the epoch of time

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
    Players can set checkpoints (epochs) in time, like bookmarks.
    At any moment, they can rewind to a saved epoch.
    but: you can only save 3 epochs per level, forcing players to strategize..

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You have to play levels and make epochs to solve puzzles and progress.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each level will have diffrent problems & new ways that you have to beat the level.
