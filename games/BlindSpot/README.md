**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
BlindSpot is a high-speed, hack-and-slash with fast paced and heavily speedrunnable gameplay, 4 bosses, and exciting abilities, and procedurally generated maps, you are thrown into a world where you are deprived of one of your core senses, Sight.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
It is a Doom-Aesthetic game, where you fight blind. You get a few powerups to overcome the disability, including a LIDAR burst (bestowed by Geuce Energy) that allows you to 'see' your surrounding for a few moments.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You perceive your world through LiDAR rays shooting out, using your newly received powers, bestowed upon you by Geuce Energy. You must pass through 80 levels, escaping the lab, using powers given to you in the lab accident in which you were blinded, to find the man who wronged you.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your  (will change as you go)?
levels, a LOT of levels (well, 80, but since procedural generation this can be infinite)
