# Shady Convenience

**Team Members:** Muhammed Lazaar, Valeria Ramirez, Nixon Hidalgo Chicas, Nicolas Rojas

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It’s like “That’s not my neighbor” meets a grocery store manager, but with a combat system like undertale and old arcade games.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player navigates through the store as they find tasks to accomplish. They interact with various tasks such as mopping the floor, running the cash register to detect counterfeit bills, catching thieves, and more!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You (the player) are an employee at the local convenience store, but there’s one issue: you need to keep up your store’s reputation. The store owner threatens your job if you don’t keep up, but if you increase the reputation enough, then he says that he might throw in a bonus. As a broke employee who is already underpaid enough, your goal is to hopefully make it through the week. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be multiple levels or “days” within the game. Each day, the player has a goal to keep their store’s reputation (completing tasks such as cleaning floors or winning mini combat battles against thieves) to keep profits afloat. Over the course of about a week, the player’s customers will become increasingly more difficult to catch and fight, but also make profit margins stricter.
