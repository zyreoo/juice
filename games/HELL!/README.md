**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like DOOM meets Superhot, but with a roguelike twist and physics-based combat.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
-Time Manipulation Combat – When you stop moving, time slows down dramatically (like Superhot), but enemies can still react slightly, making movement crucial.
-Physics-Based Attacks – No traditional bullets; all weapons launch objects or cause environmental destruction (think Half-Life 2’s Gravity Gun).
-Procedural Enemies & Weapons – Enemies have randomized attack patterns, and weapons are created dynamically, so no two runs feel the same.
-Roguelike Progression – Each run gives you power-ups that persist, but death means starting over with a different set of tools.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
-Spawn in an Arena – Players are dropped into a sci-fi cybernetic combat simulation.
-Combat Waves – Each round, waves of enemies spawn with increasing difficulty.
-Weapon & Environment Interactions – Players use weapons that manipulate objects (gravity gun, force push, telekinetic pulls, etc.).
-Time Mechanics – Movement speeds up time; stopping slows it down, allowing for strategic dodging and attacks.
-Random Power-Ups – After each wave, players choose from three randomized upgrades that modify gameplay.
-Survival & Score Chasing – The goal is to survive and rack up the highest score before inevitably dying and starting over with different abilities.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
*Dynamic Combat – Each encounter plays out differently because of the physics-based weapons.
*Skill-Based Gameplay – Players must learn how to master movement and time control to succeed.
*Ever-Changing Loadouts – Each session offers new weapons, enemies, and power-ups to keep things fresh.
*Fast-Paced Action – No downtime; every second is filled with movement, combat, and destruction.
*Destructible Environments – Players can break walls, throw objects, and use destruction as a tactical advantage.

Scope & Feasibility-
--Fast-Paced Action, Minimalist Design – Prioritizing smooth gameplay with simple, low-poly visuals for maximum performance.
--Dynamic Levels & Enemies – Procedurally generated maps and foes keep every run fresh without the need for hand-crafted layouts.
--Expandable System – Weapons, power-ups, and enemies are built modularly, allowing easy additions if time permits.
