A fast-paced 2D platformer meets a weighty, exploration-driven 3D adventure—where a mortal and Hephaestus must work together, each navigating their own world, to forge a path up Mount Olympus.

Core Mechanic:
Players control two characters in distinct yet interconnected spaces:
The Mortal, who moves with fluid, momentum-driven Celeste-style controls in a tight 2D platforming world, navigating intricate challenges to mine rare ores.
Hephaestus, who moves with a Super Mario 64–inspired weight and verticality in a 3D metroidvania-like environment, using the Mortal’s collected resources to forge powerful upgrades that reshape both worlds.

Core Gameplay Loop:
The Mortal traverses intense, linear 2D platforming challenges to extract rare ores.
Hephaestus, moving through a slower, more deliberate 3D space, uses these resources to forge weapons, tools, and environmental modifications.
As both characters power up, new pathways open, allowing them to push further up Olympus.

Progression & Engagement:
The journey up Mount Olympus unfolds across mythic regions inspired by different gods—Zeus' storm-wracked peaks, Hephaestus’ molten forge, Hermes' gravity-defying skyways. Hephaestus’ crafted tools unlock new traversal options, letting the Mortal dash further, wall-run higher, or break through barriers, while Hephaestus himself gains more control over his world through upgraded movement and combat.
As the final ascent nears, both characters must combine everything they’ve built to overcome Olympus’ last divine trial—proving that a mortal and a fallen god can stand among the pantheon.
