# Cat Puzzle

**Team Members:** Caroline Chan, Lauren Chan, Edlyn To, Elyse To

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Untitled Goose Game meets an escape room but 2D and with cats!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player will have to decode sequences through different clues and puzzles that are all cat themed. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will play as a stray cat, trying to enter various locations to see their favourite human. The player will have to submit a decoded sequence to move onto the next level, but the levels get more and more complex each time, with a limited time. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be 5 levels, each level having a time minute of 10 minutes. Each level will get more complex, with different locations and puzzles for each level.
