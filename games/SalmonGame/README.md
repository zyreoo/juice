# Salmon Game (Name WIP)
**Team Members:** Aaron Merchant
**How would you pitch this game in one line**
Its like Getting Over It, but instead of a man in a pot, you are a salmon trying to make it upstream. Additionally, Instead of controlling only the hammer, you control the fins of the fish.
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The difficulty, like getting over it and many other foddian games (games where you don't fail/ die but rather go back lots of progress). In theory, you could beat the game in like 5 minutes - but you are most likely not going to. Simple controlls (AKA just the mouse or A and D Keys) would make it easy for anyone to play. Additonally, practically everyone knows that salmon go upstream to lay their eggs - and things like mountains and bears would get in the users way as they try to make it upstream.
**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? Whats the general scope of your game?**
Idealy, the first playthrough would keep the user engaged for around 20-30 minutes, taking into account a couple of small mistakes/ setbacks, but for those with more time after they beat the game a leaderboard will appear encouraging them to top the leaderboard
