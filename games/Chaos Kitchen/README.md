How would you pitch your game in one line? You are a chef knight in his kitchen when all of a sudden his food starts to fight back because of the evil chef wizard who kidnapped his family. Now he must fight his way through the wizard's kitchen.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? The player will be trapped in a room with a set number of enemies and to attack them the player will have to collect orbs to fill an attack bar around the room to fight back all while dodging enemies who are attacking them. There will be multiple orbs each causing the player to release a different attack (ex. a knife orb that will fill an attack meter, which once full will cause the player to release a slash that will travel across the screen hurting enemies


How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) Player need to constantly avoid enemies while collecting orbs to unleash a counterattack on the enemies until all enemies in the room have been vanquished. Once a set number of rooms has been cleared the player will fight a boss. If the player is defeated they will have to restart from the beginning of the game and work their way back. The loop will be one of trial and error, constantly getting better with each run learning enemy layout, and boss patterns.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? Players will be constantly clearing rooms full of enemies and upgrading their abilities at the end of each room, getting stronger and stronger as rooms get harder and harder until the final boss is defeated. Players will have to learn the layout of each room figuring out which enemies exist in what room so they can prepare and clear each room faster and faster to regain lost progress or clear the game faster.
