**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It’s like FTL meets Titanfall but with a race for survival across dying planets

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
In "Cosmora", players control a lone space marine from a first-person perspective, racing against time to survive on hostile planets facing imminent destruction from various hazards. The core mechanic revolves around time-pressured survival runs, where each mission features a countdown timer, creating constant tension as players scavenge for resources, engage in fast-paced combat, and navigate treacherous environments to reach an escape portal before it's too late. The game’s adaptive combat and movement system adds to the thrill, with fluid mechanics like sprinting, sliding, and wall-running, combined with responsive gunplay that rewards both precision and agility. Each of the three planets—Drax-7, Helios Prime, and Nexus-9—introduces unique environmental hazards such as seismic tremors, deadly solar flares, and gravity distortions, forcing players to constantly adapt their strategies. Adding to the tension is a risk-reward scavenging system, where valuable resources are hidden in dangerous areas, challenging players to decide whether to play it safe or risk everything for powerful loot. Together, these mechanics create an intense, fast-paced experience where every second counts, and survival depends on quick thinking, sharp reflexes, and the courage to face the unknown.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
In "Cosmora", players control a lone character and must race against time to survive on dangerous planets. The core game loop revolves around exploration, combat, scavenging, and escaping before the planet becomes uninhabitable due to escalating hazards.

Players start each mission by exploring the planet, searching for resources like ammunition, health packs, and upgrades. Along the way, they engage in fast-paced combat with enemies, all while dealing with the planet’s unique environmental threats—such as seismic tremors, solar flares, or gravity distortions. The challenge intensifies as the timer counts down, forcing players to make quick decisions about whether to risk exploring for more loot or head straight for the escape portal.

Once objectives are completed, players must race to the extraction point, where the final escape becomes a tense sprint to safety. After surviving, they can use the resources they've gathered to upgrade their gear and prepare for the next mission. This loop of survival, action, and progression keeps the game intense and rewarding, offering a mix of strategy, fast reflexes, and resource management.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Dynamic, planet-specific hazards like seismic tremors or solar flares will keep players on edge, creating constant tension. Combat will be fast and fluid, with rewarding exploration that uncovers valuable resources and upgrades. Clear objectives will drive gameplay, and each mission will offer progression, new gear, and harder challenges. The game's carefully designed levels will ensure each run feels fresh.
