**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
it's a physics based playformer like sonic cd with exploration like celeste

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
the momentum and dash add a lot of fun movement opportunities, along with cool level design that makes exploring the levels fun

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
similar to sonic cd, in the game you travel to different time periods in order to make a good future. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]

similar to older platformers, the quest to make a good future in each level, along with the high skill ceiling and interesting levels should keep players engaged. hopefully 1-3 levels can be made, if i have more time i'll make some bonus stages as well!!
