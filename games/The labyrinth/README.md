The Labyrinth

**Team Members:** StriderNB

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like the maze runner, you have to escape a maze with shifting walls, traps, and enemies.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You use maps and abilities to avoid enemies and traps to reach the exit.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will select their abilities, enter the maze, use a map they can acces at certain parts of the maze, 
in order to avoid being killed by enemies, traps, or crushing walls, and to reach the exit.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The maze will increase in complexity and difficulty each time you play, as you unlock more abilities.
