**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
This game is based on the Flash game World's Hardest Game, but it's in 3d!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic that will make this game fun is the 3d aspect of the game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players are trying to complete all of the levels of the game. Some obstacles they will face are moving enemies, stationary enemies, and the player's own patience.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be engaged for 30 minutes as they move through the game, level by level, and each level will get harder with some minor mechanics added throughout the levels. This can include checkpoints, different kinds of enemies, and things that block the player's view.
