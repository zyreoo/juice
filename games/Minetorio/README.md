**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like when you combine Minecraft and Factorio

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
At the start, gathering resources. Later on, building automated farms and cool things, exploring the world.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Basically you try to survive on this planet and automate as many things as possible while hostile creatures damage your builings.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will find more things to build his building with that will make it easier and more fun
