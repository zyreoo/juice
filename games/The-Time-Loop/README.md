# The Time Loop

**Team Members:** Abhinav Madke (Solo Developer)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It’s a time-bending puzzle game where you’re stuck in a never-ending loop and need to break free by messing with time itself.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

You’re trapped in a loop and every time you open a door, you end up back where you started. To break free, you need to manipulate time—slow it down, speed it up, or rewind it to change things around you. No words, just vibes and visuals that guide you.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

You’re stuck in a loop, exploring rooms, solving puzzles, and using time-based objects (like clocks and hourglasses) to change the world around you. The more you explore, the more you unlock how time works, and you use that knowledge to find your way out. It’s a world that keeps evolving as you solve puzzles!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

The puzzles get more tricky as you progress, and every time you think you’re out, you’re not. The whole goal is to figure out how to break the time loop in 30 minutes. The more you experiment with time, the more the world changes, and you start seeing new stuff you missed before.
