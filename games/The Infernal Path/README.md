# The Infernal Path

**Team Members:** Toby (Hobbes-2) & Micah (ImTrying09)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A thrilling adventure about traversing the nine circles of hell and escaping back to the overworld for reasons unkown...

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** 
Having a top down rougelike style game like this will make it so there are many unique possiblilities that will lead to many mechanics, but I think that one major mechanic will be 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players will fight their way through demons to get to the lowest circle of hell. At the end of each circle there will be a bossfight that will grant the player with a "blessing" of that leader of hell. (IE, Velhadrus, who I am planning to make the leader of the first circle of hell.
Upon defeat of Velhadrus the players will get its blessing, allowing them to cloak themselves for a short time.)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
In order to keep players engaged, we will be constructing a gameplay that is fast and gives oppertunity to use all aquired gear and abilities to their extent. Along with a goal at the end to reach the overworld (Ill come up for a reason to try to get to the overworld) it will be a compelling story that is led by actions and animations alone, with no need for words.
