2. Collect & Analyze Data - Gather water samples, run tests, and determine contamination sources.
3. Investigate & Hack - Cross-check findings with industrial reports, hack into corporate databases, and expose cover-ups.
4. Expose the Truth - Choose how to reveal the pollution (news, lawsuits, activism), each affecting the story differently.
5. Survive Retaliation - Companies may try to silence you through bribes, threats, or sabotage, leading to strategic gameplay choices.
