Explore & Navigate üèöÔ∏è

Traverse eerie, oversized environments filled with haunting details.
Solve platforming challenges using climbing, jumping, and interacting with objects.
Solve Environmental Puzzles üîç

Find hidden paths, push/pull objects, and manipulate the environment to progress.
Use light, physics, and sound creatively to solve challenges.
Stealth & Evasion üë§

Hide under tables, inside cabinets, or in the shadows to avoid grotesque enemies.
Use distractions (throw objects, turn off lights, etc.) to sneak past threats.
Chase & Escape Sequences üö™

Sudden, intense encounters where players must run, dodge, and find exits quickly.
Enemies adapt to movement patterns, making each chase dynamic.
Storytelling & Lore Discovery üìñ

Uncover the dark mystery of the world through environmental storytelling.
Find cryptic symbols, notes, or memories that deepen the horror atmosphere.

As players progress, enemies get smarter, puzzles become harder, and the world gets darker.
The sense of fear builds as safe spaces become fewer and threats intensify.
