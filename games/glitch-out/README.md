# Glitch Out

**Team Members:** Soham

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Relish true experiences of life through escaping norms set by society.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic set in this game are glitch(es). A glitch is something that stands out, something, in this case, which gets you closer to fulfillment and boundless experiences.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players are trying to glitch as many times as possible, getting continually closer to their goal, which is freedom. The challenges they face are bots, entities that regulate norms. They must escape these bots to obtain glitches, and these glitches are also the rewards, as they grant the player a certain degree of freedom.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
I would keep the players engaged for quite more than 30 minutes, by not letting them get comfortable in the game easily. After they obtain rewards (glitches in this case), the game will be presented in such a way so as to amplify their remaining degrees of dependence. It will seem to get harder as the player progresses through the game, but alas, at the end, when true freedom and thus fulfillment is reached, the player will look back, and hopefully, enjoy the gameplay experience.
