# **DeepRoots**

**Developer:** Lopa

## **Pitch**
"It's like Stardew Valley meets Terraria but with a deeper underground exploration system and dynamic world events."

## **Key Mechanics**
- **Farming & Automation:** Farming isn't just planting and harvesting; players can automate parts of the process using machines and magical enhancements.
- **Underground Biomes & Dungeons:** Unlike Terraria, biomes change dynamically over time, requiring adaptation.
- **Dynamic World Events:** Seasons bring natural disasters, monster invasions, and hidden treasures, making the world feel alive.
- **Village Growth:** Players develop a village, attracting NPCs with unique skills that assist with farming, crafting, and defense.

## **Core Gameplay Loop**
1. **Farming & Gathering:** Start with a small farm, grow crops, raise animals, and gather materials from the wild.
2. **Exploration & Combat:** Venture underground to discover rare materials, battle creatures, and uncover lost technologies.
3. **Crafting & Building:** Use resources to build machines, improve the farm, and expand the village.
4. **Surviving & Thriving:** Adapt to seasonal changes and random events like monster attacks or lost travelers needing help.
5. **Progression & Customization:** Unlock better tools, upgrade the village, and develop unique playstyles through skill trees.

## **Player Engagement & Scope**
- **Short-term Goals:** Manage time effectively within in-game days to maximize efficiency.
- **Mid-term Goals:** Expand the farm, upgrade tools, and build relationships with NPCs.
- **Long-term Goals:** Unlock new biomes, expand the village, and master different playstyles.
- **Random Events & Challenges:** Introduce unpredictability with events like ancient ruins appearing or sudden storms damaging crops.
