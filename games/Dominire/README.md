**How would you pitch your game in one line?** It's like Celeste, but 2 layers!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** It's a puzzle platformer, with a background layer aswell as a front layer, and your goal is to use either layer to your advantage to cross!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** You start in the foreground layer, and you can move that character but not the other character in the background layer until you switch the layers.
You have to use the other layer in certain obstacles to cross difficult jumps!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** We plan to possibly add opponents and fights later on, aswell as potentially procedural generation.
