**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You're a creature in a dark world where you "see" through sound waves.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- The environment only reveals itself when you make noises (jumping, walking, stomping, a sonar ability, placing down waypoints that emit sound, etc.)
- Certain sounds attract predators, so you must strategically navigate the levels without making too much noise
- Different surfaces react to sound differently (metal amplifies/conducts... grass dampens...)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- The player controls character with limited defense or attacking capabilities, relying on stealth and evasion techniques to survive in the cold, dark world
- Physics, puzzles, and creepy creatures will block the player's progress forward, and the player must get around them using platforming skills and strategy
- The gameplay could be split into levels or be continuous, but checkpoints should be common because dying will be common
- The player unlocks new abilites as the progress, all themed around sound

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
- The monsters are based off of deep sea creatures and will get smarter, faster, and more dangerous as the levels progress and the player dives deeper into the ocean (earlier monsters will glow, while some more advanced monsters hide themselves in the shadows)
- As the depth increases, the amount of darkness in the level will also increase, which will make use of abilities more important
- The puzzles will become more difficult too, requiring more sound to fully scope out all aspects of the environment, attracting more attention
- However, the new sound-based abilities the player gets as the levels progress will give them the ability to outmaneuver or possibly trap any enemies, or uncover their surroundings faster, which makes the challenges possible with enough skill
- Some amount of procedural generation could be considered (would take the game in more of an open-world direction), but so far this idea seems better suited for a premade environment
