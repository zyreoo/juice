**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Dark Souls meets Slay the Spire, but with a constantly shifting reality that alters the rules of combat and exploration.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Reality Shifting: The game world has two parallel dimensions—"Light Realm" and "Shadow Realm." Players can shift between them, revealing hidden paths, new enemies, and different combat strategies.
Adaptive Combat: Weapons and abilities change effectiveness depending on which realm you're in, forcing players to think strategically.
Deck-Building Enhancements: Players collect “Echo Cards” that modify combat abilities, offering dynamic playstyles similar to Slay the Spire.
Procedurally Generated Levels: Each run is unique, providing different layouts, enemy placements, and story fragments.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Exploration: Players navigate a ruined world, uncovering lore, choosing paths, and discovering hidden secrets in both dimensions.
Combat: Battles use a mix of action RPG combat and deck-building mechanics, where players combine melee attacks, spells, and Echo Cards to adapt to shifting realities.
Shifting Mechanics: Some enemies are only vulnerable in certain realms, requiring players to switch dimensions mid-battle.
Upgrades & Choices: At key moments, players must pick between different Echo Cards, artifacts, or stat boosts that will define their playstyle for the rest of the run.
Boss Fights: Massive, multi-phase bosses force players to shift between realms and rethink their approach dynamically.
Permadeath & Progression: While death resets the run, players can unlock permanent buffs and relics that carry over to future attempts.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What’s the general scope of your game?**
Variety of Choices: Every run feels different thanks to randomized level layouts, Echo Cards, and enemy encounters.
Skill-Based Combat: The challenge of adapting to shifting realms keeps players engaged.
Rogue-lite Progression: Even if they fail, players unlock permanent upgrades, encouraging them to try again.
Mystery & Story Unfolding: Hidden lore, NPC interactions, and secret areas encourage repeated playthroughs to piece together the game's full story.
