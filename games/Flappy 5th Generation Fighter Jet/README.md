Flappy 5th Generation Fighter Jet

**Team Members:** Muyao, Rachel

**How would you pitch your game in one line?** A Flappy Bird inspired game, except instead of a bird, it's a fighter jet plane with fighter jet plane abilities.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** Levelling up your fighter jet and unlocking more cool abilities. You start with a basic plane with limited speed control, weapons, etc..., and level it up by completing levels for more advanced abilities, higher health, faster speed, and other powers. You also get to shoot missiles at the annoying green tubes, it that helps.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** You start with a basic jet plane that can't do much except for change speed and fly around, but as you complete more levels, you can slowly upgrade your plane, with abilities such as bombs, machine guns, higher health, etc... to get further on the level. You will, however, as you progress, also encounter harder enemies, instead of just those boring green tubes. Things like turrets, missiles, other planes that chase you to keep the game challenging. In addition to that, minigames could also be introduced to the main game that allows the player to obtain special items that can't be found in core gameplay, such as powerful 1 use weapons, or additional lives.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** I will engage players with a tech tree of upgrades for your fighter jet, as well as with enemies of increasing difficulty as you progress into the game. Minigames will also be introduced as the game progresses for players to gain special, powerful items. Finally, a global leaderboard would also help challenge players who are further in the game, adding a reward for more competitive players.
