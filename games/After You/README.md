# After You

**Team Members:**

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

- It's a 2D side-view fast-paced zombie survival game where, when your character dies, a new 'you' steps into the same room, picks up where the last one fell


**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

- *Barricading & Time Pressure*: During exploration, you can barricade doors to create temporary safe zones, but zombies will eventually break in, forcing you to act quickly.

- *Fast-Paced Survival*: Zombies chase you relentlessly, but moments of calm allow you to explore, heal, and upgrade weapons, creating a balance between tension and strategy.

- *Persistent Death Mechanic*: When you die, a new survivor enters the world at the exact spot where the last one fell, inheriting the state of the environment



**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

- *Survive*: Fight or evade zombies using limited weapons and stealth. Manage resources and make quick decisions.

- *Objectives*: Explore the environment, gather resources, upgrade weapons, and find safe zones to rest.

- *Rewards*: Hidden loot, rare items. Successfully surviving longer opens new rooms with more resources and tougher zombies.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

- *Long-Term Engagement*: Players experiment with different survival strategies. The continuity mechanic adds a meta-layer of progression, as player will have their old things 

- *Short-Term Engagement*: The gameâ€™s tension comes from the constant threat of zombies, and the need to manage limited resources. Each run feels fresh due to randomization (e.g., zombie spawns, item locations, etc.)


[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]

- *Randomized Rooms*: Each room has different layouts, resources, and threats for exciting exploration.

- *Temporary Safe Zones*: Barricade doors to create safe zones, but zombies eventually break in.

- *Time Pressure*: Balance looting, healing, and upgrading with the risk of zombies breaking through.

- *Environmental Storytelling*: Bloodstains, broken doors, and items tell the survival of people before you 

- *Random Events*: Unexpected events (e.g., helicopter flyovers, hordes) add unpredictability.
