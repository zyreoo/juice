**Team Members:** [Andy]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A game where you have to save the world (bruh idk, how am I supposed to know I came up with the idea not nowing games that are similar)

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- You control light, wind, and water to revive dead plants and solve environmental puzzles.
- Switch between a spirit (walking & interacting) and a bird (flying & reaching new areas) to explore the world.
- Restoring flowers unlocks ghostly visions of the lost civilization, revealing the gameâ€™s story.
- As you restore life, the environment visibly transforms, making progress feel satisfying.
- Instead of fighting, you wake up giant ancient creatures by solving puzzles on their bodies.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players explore a mystical, dying floating garden, using light and nature-based powers to revive it. They switch between spirit and bird forms, solve environmental puzzles, and unlock memories of a lost civilization.
(More Coming Soon)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
A clear goal (restore the floating garden)
Meaningful progression (world changes as you play)
Layered challenges (puzzles that get more complex)
A sense of mystery (unraveling the lost civilization)
