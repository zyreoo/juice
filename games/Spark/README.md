# Introducing: Spark ✨

### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**

*A small spark of kindness travels from person to person, creating ripples that either brighten the world or dim it—depending on the choices you make*

"Spark" tells its story without words, relying on the universal language of human connection. Through movement, color, and emotion-driven interactions, the game illustrates how even the acts ripple outward, shaping the world in unseen ways. The game emphasizes that kindness transcends words; it is something felt, understood, and passed forward, no matter who we are or where we come from.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

- You play as a spark that passes from one person to another, influencing their actions
- The spark changes color based on your decisions—soft, warm hues for kindness, or duller, darker tones when negativity spreads
- Your choices determine how the next person carries the spark forward, whether it continues as kindness or spirals into negativity
- The world is full of characters with unseen struggles, and your kindness helps unlock hidden stories over time
- The game starts dull and muted, but as your spark spreads, the world slowly brightens; colors become warmer, music swells, and characters interact more joyfully

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

1. **Observe & Explore** ✨ – The player starts as a small, glowing spark, floating through an environment, looking for someone to pass onto
2. **Interact & Choose** 🦋 – Players can interact with objects, environments, and people:
    - Giving a tired worker a coffee → they smile at a stranger instead of snapping → the stranger helps someone else
    - Returning a lost object → it helps someone meet a friend they wouldn’t have otherwise
    - Helping someone carry their heavy bags → they feel appreciated and decide to call a loved one they’ve been neglecting
    - Sharing an umbrella with a stranger in the rain → they arrive at work in a good mood → they pass on encouragement to a struggling coworker
3. **See the Ripples Unfold** 🌀 – At first, changes are subtle, but over time, these small actions build into visible changes in the world
4. **Unlock New Interactions** 🔓 – As the world shifts, new characters and events appear. The player can go deeper into their complex stories

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What’s the general scope of your game?**

- **Short, Meaningful Interactions** 🏡 – Each small act takes just a few seconds but has a lasting impact; players stay engaged by seeing the effects of their choices. As players progress, they uncover hidden struggles of the characters they touch, making each interaction deeper
- **Unfolding Connections** 🔄 – As more kindness spreads, the player starts noticing how different characters’ stories intertwine, making them curious to explore further
- **Multiple Endings 📖 —** Depending on how the spark is passed, the game ends with a world that’s either glowing with connection, fractured with loneliness, or something in between
- **Gradual Transformation** 🎨 – The environment evolves based on the player’s actions, creating a rewarding visual and emotional payoff
- **Mystery of Cause & Effect** 🧩 – Players won’t immediately see how their actions impact others, encouraging them to keep playing to witness the full butterfly effect
