# Game Name

**Team Members:** [Madhav Garg, Ziyu Jin. Joey Wang, Leo Wilson]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like copter royale (on cool math games) but 3D

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The power ups are one of the key mechanics that make this game fun. It is these power ups that bring variety to the game and a sort of secondary goal.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The goal of the game is to pop all of the other players. As you wander around the map, there are power ups all over the place, so you get stronger and stronger. In turn, as you get stronger you are able to pop other players easier.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be different players and power ups throughout the game.
