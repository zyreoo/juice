# Plagued

**Member:** Luca

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
An open-world RPG taking place in Renaissance Italy where a plague doctor has to fight and survive a mind-bending plague.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
One key mechanic is our protagonist's paranoia, the more paranoid and more damage the doctor takes the more the environment around them distorts. 
A general run and dodge will be implemented to ensure your survival, resources and ammo can be collected from fallen enemies and used to craft materials.
There will also be items and secrets in certain areas for you to find granting rewards.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You will play as the plague doctor and use Renaissance-era weapons to fight the former citizens of Italy and try and survive.
You will navigate streets and explore as you try and go to your next objective.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

There will be several streets to navigate and a solid objective to follow, while you survive and try to decipher what is real and what isn't.
There will be several areas and cities to explore as you try to escape and find the cause behind the plague.
Secrets and shortcuts will be part of Plagued encouraging the user to explore to find rewards to make you stronger.
There will be certain points where your game autosaves so if you die you can respawn where the autosave was triggered.
