**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like The Legend of Zelda meets Dark Souls but with crafting mechanics

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Crafting weapons and equipment that take some properties of the enemies you defeat. (E.g. defeating a fire creature gives you cores that you can apply to make your weapons deal fire damage, slimes can be used to make armor with increased physical damage reduction and many more...) 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players explore levels and defeat enemies to prepare and save the villagers from the power of corruption, which is threatening to destroy the whole village.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Keep battle engaging by crafting good enemy AI and having a wide variety of enemies and a wide catalog of items to craft and discover and ultimately, a worthy boss battle at the end of the experience.
