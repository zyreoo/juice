# Unreal Dungeons

*Team Members:* Andr√©s & Helman

*How would you pitch your game in one line?*
It's a plattaformer game inspired in games like Celeste and another things by Mario Maker but with our own touch, the characteristic we are thinking about is the use of some items to give an unique thematic to each dungeon.

*What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?*
Okay, the mechanics are the power-ups based gameplay, in which in order to get to solve the next dungeon you'll need an specific power-up item and maybe find the necessary combination.

*How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)*
It will be pretty simple, you'll only use a few letter on your keyboard, maybe like the arrows for movement and other one maybe two, to use the power-ups, it's basically linear, so it will be easy to understand, just getting to the next room and achieve an item or some other reward (maybe coins or something like that) at the end of each.

*How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?*
We think it'll be engaging because of the difficulty increment of each room and the drastic change that each room mechanics will have, so they'll face an epic challenge and want to complete it.
