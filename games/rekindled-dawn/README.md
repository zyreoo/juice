**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like hyper light drifter meets Zelda with an isometric view, puzzles, and an unique language system

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanics for the game is mostly the combat system and language related puzzles. It'll be a very smooth and satisfying combat system, with fun but challenging enemies. The language system will be very intuitive-ish. And we will have an extra fun mechanic (sadly can't spoil).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players will try to reach the skies and climb levels to solve an ongoing crisis in the world. While doing so they will be met with enemies, bosses, a foreign language and puzzles. The core game loop will be encountering more difficult enemies and upgrading our weapons and abilities.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
We will focus on making the gameplay smooth and addicting for the best user experience. We also have multiple level designs + unique bosses.
