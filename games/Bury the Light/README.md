# Bury the Light

**Team Members:** [Marie Wright, Caro Robertson, Aidan Alaniz, Kasen Davis]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Think of a platformer with a style similar to Hollow Knight, and a meeting of the light elements of Amnesia, The Dark Descent.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Bringing fun combat mechanics mixed with sensory deprivation only slightly mitigated by the amount of health (light) you have. Its you vs. the environment with the main enemy being everything around you.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc] We follow the protagonist on his journey to escape the pit and find the light. With an undertone on aspects of depression.  The protagonist solves puzzles to escape his prison, on the way he collects lightbulbs to help him on his journey.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
A large uni-level platformer with sub-environments accessible through story points or hidden locations with multilayering for level design and combat mechanics (ex. Slash, Jab, Parry) with a emphasis on environmental combat w/ a goal to escape.
