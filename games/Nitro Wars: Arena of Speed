Game Pitch
It's a simple combat racing game where players race through shifting tracks, collect power-ups, and use combat abilities to sabotage opponents.

Key Mechanics
- Dynamic Arena Tracks – The racecourse is randomly generated or shifts during gameplay, introducing new challenges like obstacles or shortcuts.  
- Boost & Nitro System – Players can collect Nitro by performing stunts or near-misses, which can then be used for speed boosts.  
- Combat Racing – Use simple attack mechanics like EMPs or missiles to disrupt opponents.  
- Track Hazards – The track may contain randomly appearing obstacles, such as moving walls or traps that affect the race.  
- Upgrades & Power-ups – Collect items during the race to enhance your vehicle's performance, like speed boosts, shields, or missile upgrades.

Core Game Loop

2. Race & Survive – Navigate a dynamically shifting track, avoiding obstacles and attacking opponents.  
3. Use Boost & Combat – Collect Nitro and use it to get ahead or defend against attacks.

5. Win or Upgrade – Finish the race, earn rewards, and use them to unlock better vehicles or upgrades.
