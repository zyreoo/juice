# Flower Rescue

**Team Members:** Christina

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Sky: Children of the Light meets Fancy Pants Man but a witch with a flying broom.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You will play a witch on the journey to save the worldâ€™s power source - sun. You would collect fallen sun energy on the way as you make your adventure to the clouds. Initially you would have a broken broom and can not do much but as you collect more sun energy you can fly longer distance and faster.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player would use their skills to pass through platforms while collecting sun energy. They jump, use materials and fly with their broom, etc. The finial goal is to reach the sun and save the sun flower through recharging it with energy.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Players will stage engaged by increased difficulty and upgrade of skills.The player would go through 3 maps of plain, mountain and clouds to reach the sun. The collected energy would upgrade your broom, increasing your ability to reach farther jumping distance.
