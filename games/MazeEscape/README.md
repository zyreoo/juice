# Maze escape

**Team Members:** Ond≈ôej Vacek

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You need to escape mazes and use new tools to get throu them as fast as you can.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
It's 2d game where you navigate throu mazes, but your vision is limited. You can find new tools (torch, gas mask, axe). There will be obsticles on the way (fallen tree, traps) and enemies (you can evade them or fight them).  At the end of each level you can buy something from the shop. There will be power ups in the shop (torch, armour, speed potion)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
player needs to finish several levels of mazes. Each maze has time limit. You need to avoid obsticles to get to the finish. If somehing kills or you dont finish it in the time limit you you lose your progres in the level and have to do it again. You can get money from going throu mazes or finding them on the go.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The more you play, the more chalanging it gets, but you also unlock new powerups that help you in the game. The difficulty increases so it wont be easy all the time, ensuring the game remains challenging. The time limit is going to make it harder for the player, so he will need to act and think quick.
