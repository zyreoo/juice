# Lost & Found

**Team Members:** Izzy

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Exploration game with combat and platform mechanics, some inspiration taken from Stardew Valley and Celeste.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Search an abandoned city for lost objects while uncovering and fighting previously undisturbed monsters. Searching and uncovering secrets make it fun as well as the platforming and minigames.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players are given the outline of lost objects which they must find by exploring. Along the way they must fight monsters, recruit help and level up. When an object is found a platformer level is played to unlock it. More secrets are uncovered as the game progresses, the game has been won when all objects are found.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The urge to discover the entire map, and complete your collection aims to keep players hooked. As special objects are acquired gameplay styles may change.
