# Rampant Routing

**Team Members:** Sam

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You're an engineer routing PCBs on a tight timeline, with components being added every secondâ€”but you don't have an undo button.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
In a limited space, route traces to connect all components. As more components are added, you need to think ahead to leave room for future parts as you can't move previous traces. This is a fast-paced puzzle game that requires you to think many steps ahead!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Route PCBs similar to a PCB design software (but simplier), earn curency for routing components and purchase upgrades (like increased board space, vias, and autorouting) as the game adds more and more things to route, increasing in speed.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There's more than one correct way to route PCBs. Players have to balance speed, room, and upgrades. This is a game that's easy to pick up but has a high skill ceiling. As new, complicated components get introduced, players need to adapt their strategy to progress with the game. This game can go on indefinitly.
