# Killer Instincts

**Team Members:** Hashim Ali, David, Medhansh Kapoor, Nox

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like a battle royal meets survival horror, but with evolving instincts that change your gameplay style as you adapt to your environment.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The key mechanic is the evolution of killer instincts. Players develop new abilities based on their actions—stealth, aggression, or strategy—which alters how they approach combat and survival. This creates dynamic, unpredictable gameplay where no two matches feel the same.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players are dropped into an isolated environment filled with dangers. They must gather resources, eliminate threats, and adapt their instincts based on decisions they make. As they survive longer or defeat stronger enemies, their abilities evolve, offering new powers or traits that change how they engage with both the environment and other players.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

The constant evolution of player abilities keeps gameplay fresh. Every match offers different strategies based on how players choose to evolve. Dynamic environments, hidden threats, and player-versus-player encounters ensure there's always something new to react to, keeping tension and excitement high for extended play sessions.
