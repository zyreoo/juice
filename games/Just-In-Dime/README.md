# Just-In-Dime

**Team Members:** Carlo Allietti, Michael Borov, Zayan Islam

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
Our game is a dungeon crawler meets platformer that takes the switching of 3-D to 2-D levels in Mario Odyssey and puts it at the press of a keystroke. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The core mechanic of our game is the ability to switch dime(nsions) at the press of a keystroke and make use of the benefits of both 2-D and 3-D design. Switching between dimensions is seameless and every change you make in one dimension directly impacts that in the other, outside of the axis which you can not view (e.g pushing a block up and down vertically would not matter in the 2-D view).
  
This core mechanic is fun because it allows a combination of approaches to every level and allows for interesting and unique puzzle and enemy design/player interactions.
  
Each dimension has its own benefits: 3-D offers fluidity of motion while 2-D offers speed of combat. Effectively using both dimensions is important to ensuring the game flows quickly and is fun!  

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Players work through a series of dungeons, fighting enemies and collecting loot that benefits them in both dimensions, with certain pieces of gear adding specials buffs to our perspective warping protagonist. Players will fight through many proceduraly generated rooms, working their way up to 2 bosses throughout the course of the game.  
  
In the end, players are trying to escape the end and everything within our world will try to stop them. They will face challenging puzzles, tricky bosses, and a slew of enemies/traps to fight their way through in each "room" of the world.  
  
Also, players will experience engaging 3-D platforming and find meaningful ways to traverse our world while leveraging their powers!  

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
Players will be kept engaged because they are going to find unique ways to use their powers in our world. We plan to start our game as a basic dungeon crawler, then expand to platforming sections, and finally to puzzle rooms and even bosses.   
  
As players go through the game, they will earn powerups that augment their dimensional abilities and allow them to explore old concepts (like a basic dungeon) in new ways through these enhanced abilities.  
  
Overall, we plan to keep players engaged by mixing and matching the core facets of our game in unique ways while also introducing interesting new concepts to our player throughout the 30 minute runtime.
