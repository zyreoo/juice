# Deception

**Team Members:** Rohan

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Stranded on an island with other competing agents, trade resources to secure the only ticket leaving the island, but beware: the other agents *will* deceive and backstab you at any point.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is trading with the shopkeepers on the island and with other agents. The mechanic is important because the player needs to trade to secure 10 gold (the price of leaving the island), but they'll be competing against other agents which are racing against them to leave the island before them.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
On the map (the island), there will be various shops such as the blacksmith (iron --> gold), fishing hut (equipment --> gold), shop (gold --> other resources), etc. The player can go around to other shops to trade, as well as trade with the other agents roaming the island.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
 At the top of the screen, there will be a timer for one week, which is how long before the only ship leaving the island departs. At the beginning of each morning, various random events will occur, disrupting the player's plans. The player will have to continually adapt and be wary of the other agents, who can backstab them at any point.
