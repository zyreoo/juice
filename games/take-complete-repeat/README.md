**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It is a 3D side scrolling shooter game! With a 3D skill tree, many different abilites and a lot of fun tasks to do for progression.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is the player ability system. As the player unlocks more of the skill tree,
they receive abilities they can equip at certain areas to help progress through the game easier.
This mechanic allows for many fun combos to make every player's gameplay unique and match their playstyle.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player starts at a reception desk where they can take on a task or two.
After exiting through a door they get to an area where they can complete those tasks.
The usual tasks are similar to Helldivers 2 missions: retrieving data, launching probes, and regaining control of stations (subject to change).
The primary obstacle is enemies, gray creatures that come out of the fog and attack the player.
After finishing a task the player receives more budget and can unlock more of the skill tree.
As the player's budget increases they can receive harder and longer tasks.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player has many different options in the skill tree. They can choose the path that they find the most fun.
The levels are procedurally generated and tasks are random which makes every gameplay different and the number of possiblites unlimited.
