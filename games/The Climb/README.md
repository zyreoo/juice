# Game Name
The Climb

**Team Members:** Yashas Singh

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Imagine a PC VR game where *The Climb* meets *Getting Over It*, immersing players in a physics-driven climbing adventure that forgoes guided gameplay, requiring them to rely solely on instincts, tools, and problem-solving to conquer the raw challenge of the mountain, all while a dynamic music system reacts to every step, enhancing both immersion and difficulty.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Built for PC VR, the game uses realistic climbing physics that require players to physically reach, grip, and pull themselves up using their hands and specialized tools. Unlike traditional games that offer hints and tutorials, this experience forces players to rely on common sense and environmental cues to progress. Climbing tools such as pitons, ice axes, and ropes are crucial for tackling different terrains, requiring strategic thinking about when and how to use them. Music plays a major role in shaping the experience, evolving dynamically to reflect progress, tension, and danger. Subtle sound cues, such as the clinking of metal, shifts in wind intensity, and the cracking of rock, provide non-verbal hints that help players navigate the climb without breaking immersion.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players begin by assessing their environment, scanning for climbable surfaces and potential hazards. Once a route is determined, they must use precise hand movements and tools to execute their plan. The game constantly demands adaptation, as unexpected obstacles like crumbling holds, fatigue, or shifting weather conditions force players to rethink their approach. The dynamic soundtrack heightens this experience, making every moment feel meaningful—whether it's the tense quiet before a dangerous move or the triumphant swell of music as players reach new heights. The ultimate goal is to reach the summit, experiencing both the physical and emotional journey of overcoming the mountain’s challenges.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Designed to keep players engaged for at least 30 minutes, the game introduces new challenges and tools at a steady pace, ensuring a sense of progression. The dynamic music system enhances immersion, making the climb feel alive and responsive. With varied environments ranging from rocky cliffs to icy walls and stormy peaks, each section of the climb presents fresh gameplay opportunities. The initial scope of the game focuses on a single, carefully designed mountain with multiple paths to the summit. Replayability comes from different route choices, tool restrictions, and the natural variance in player decision-making. Future expansions could introduce new mountains, advanced weather effects, or even multiplayer challenges.
