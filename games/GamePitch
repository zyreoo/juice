**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
2D racing game built around individual component control of thrusters and servos

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Individual control of each component and fine tuning. Low entry level but high skill ceiling for steering and racing.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Navigate around asteroid fields and stars, trying to move as fast as you can to outrun your opponents. The controls aren't easy to master, but once you get a feel for them you'll see theres a high skill ceiling

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Difficult gameplay and a feeling that there's more to be learned. Similar to games like Rain World which rely on the environment for storytelling.
