**Team Members:** [Anas Kamel (Sand)]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?** A cursed human trapped in a broken toy like body, trying to reclaim their lost humanity by battling monsters and elemental guardians with each fight and choice shaping their future and revealing their past

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** fast paced choice-driven game deep progression and emotional story telling quite like undertale

**How does the game actually play?** (Core game choices and bonds) Spirit is wandering free, haunts a broken toy body, in a interconnected world beneath earth surface where elementals and demons rule the place you fight them to reclaim your humanity shape your future based on your choices evolve your combat as you claim more humanity and uncover the truth of your past you have three routes, the redeemed (pacifist path) fully human and hints that you will guide others to break the curse, the hollow one (neutral path) a mix of a human and puppet like features some npcs fear you unsure of what you become and you feel something is missing through your dialouges being detached, the forgotten beast (ruthless path) your body fursed with the elemental forces becoming inhuman, you are unrecognizable a twisted fusion of all the bosses you consumed, some fear you and some worship you as a god and others want to destroy you the final cutscene is you standing at the edge of the world wondering if there is anything left to fight for

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** mmake them emotionally bond to their character as the bosses and eneimes reveal a little about you each time and the more humanity and body parts you regain the more you are closer to finding your true past were your curse justifed and you were a monster? or was it cruel and you were just a gentle soul
