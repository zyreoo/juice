**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

A top-down puzzle-exploration game where you guide a glowing orb through dark mazes, using light to reveal paths, solve puzzles, and avoid hidden dangers.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Light is your only tool. You can only see what your orb illuminates, making every step a discovery. Doors, platforms, and hidden hazards react to light, turning movement into a puzzle.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Roll through the maze, lighting up your surroundings, solving puzzles, and dodging hazards to reach the exit. Each level introduces new ways to use light to progress.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

New mechanics, hidden paths, and interactive elements keep things fresh. The game rewards exploration and challenges players to think creatively with light.
