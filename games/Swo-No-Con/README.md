Swo-No-Con

**Team Members:** Tanmay Garg

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its a demi souls game but instead of making the bosses hard I made the controls hard!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
I am going to simulate sword fighting, trying to make the swings look realistic but making those swings is going to be hard which will be the fun factor of the game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players go through trials and different boss fights to reach the end and recieve a better sword

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The general scope of the game is to defeat all the bosses which will have different attack pattern and stats to reach the end for a better sword they can use in their next run. The boss fights are not going to be easy because of the controls so it will be a fun challenge.
