# Game Name Cafrerria

**Team Members:** [liam and alex]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[it's like terraria but it's about running a cafe as a big cat.]" (doesn't have to follow this format)

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[building up your cafe and exploring the world to gain new resources, recipes, or items from your cafe.]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[The main character, a large cat, starts off by discovering a beta up cfa in the woods. They are then prompted visually with an arrow to search and begin to rebuild it. After the base reconstruction has been completed the player is shown the base mechanics of how to craft juices, recipes, items, and gather the resources required to level up the cafe. The game is open world, so the player doesn't have to rebuild it and can do other things but some areas are locked without completion of key objectives. Theplayer will be renewed with unlocks and new items or recipes every stage they level up the cafe. They will also have to deal with weather, enemies or rude customers. All will give rewards such as new recipes and blueprints/building materials. The rude customer specifically gives extra money. As they progress, more people show up to the cafe after more juices are discovered. The main mechanisms are items,rebuilding,blueprints,money,recipes, and resources.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
[I plan to keep people engaged by letting them explore the world themselves after the tutorial, so there are a massive amount of possibilities of what they can do so they never get bored of playing. The general scope is to run a chill cafe while exploring a 2d pixel art world.]
