MIRRORSWAP
Team Members: Tanish, Aidan, Tejas

How would you pitch your game in one line?
A fast-paced platformer where you flip between two mirrored dimensions to navigate an ever-shifting world.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The ability to swap between two realities at any moment to avoid obstacles, fight enemies, and fluid movement. 

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)

Player enters a level with a clear goal (reach the exit or defeat the boss).
The world shifts between two mirrored versionsâ€”one safe, one deadly. Sometimes both can be deadly and you'll have to decide which one you'll travel in based on resources you have.
Players must time their flips carefully to avoid hazards and chain fast movements.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The constant chase for better times and smoother movement will keep players engaged. Levels are designed to be short but highly replayable, with leaderboards and hidden tricks to master.
