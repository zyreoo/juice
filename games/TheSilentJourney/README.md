**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

walk through landscapes. look around, notice details. find special spots to interact with. feel emotions from the world. move to new areas. traversing could include walking, running, climbing etc.. there would be different stages of the game (e.g. beginning out pretty somber, keeps going to become more peaceful, eventually gets happy)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

different environments that they haven't gone through before. there'll be changes in the mood etc. (see above)
