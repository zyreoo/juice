**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You control two players at the same time, one moving normally and the other in reverse, with the goal of using your skills to navigate through difficult levels that require coordination and creativity.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic of this game is in the "mirror" gimmick of the player
* The main character (this could be swapped later) moves normally accordingly to your inputs (right moves right, left moves left, etc)
* The other character moves in a way that mirrors the main character (right moves left, left moves right)

This gives us room for creating unique, asymmetrical levels that rely on players being able to coordinate their movements in ways that will allow both characters to succeed. A move that is effective for one character may be disadvantageous for the other.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will navigate through platformer-style levels with obstacles and interactive puzzles they'll have to solve to move on. The goal is to guide the characters safely through the level while mitigating the risks of their clashing movements. The levels get increasingly harder and new elements are introduced as the game progresses that will force players to think beyond basic strategies alone.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will learn a unique gimmick that they will have to figure the ins-and-outs of as they progress through the levels. As the levels increase in difficulty, so does the chaos. New elements and interactive features will be introduced as the player continues to explore a fractured world they must piece together with their two halves.

Some ideas
* The game will have up to 10 levels in chapter 1 (with the last level being a kind of "boss stage")
* Some interesting elements that could be introduced later are
  - gravity shifts (alter the way gravity works with the characters or level)
  - time shift (slow down or speed up time)
  - mirror swaps (possibly a feature that allows you to swap the main character)
  - decoupling? (where a character's movement can become independent of the other for a brief period of time)
  - enemies? (mirrored components of both the characters that work against you)
  - multiplayer (this could be cool but probably won't be done until all the core features are in)
