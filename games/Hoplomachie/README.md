**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
An RPG pixel art game focused on fencing and time travel. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game features an engaging story with easy-to-learn battle techniques, making it accessible to players of all skill levels, and languageless so anyone can play.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player wakes up in a modern room, only to find something unexpected. A simple action sends them to an ancient world filled with new sights and challenges. As they explore, they meet a group of warriors with unique skills, who invite them to join their journey. But every choice has consequences. Will they find their way back home, or embrace this new life?

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will face easy duels and challenges that build up to a final arena battle. The game will use visual storytelling and increase the difficulty gradually to keep things interesting.
