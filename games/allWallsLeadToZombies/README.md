**All Walls Lead to Zombies**

**Team Members:** Spencer Wu + Landon Quan + David Zhao

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a battle between two players to see who can outlast a mob of zombies using protective walls. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Player 1 and Player 2 compete against each other by building up as many layers of walls around themselves to protect against dangerous zombies. 

In order to build a layer of protective wall around themselves, Player 1 and Player 2 must complete random tasks. With each task completed, a layer of wall is dropped onto the player, protecting them against vicious zombies. Players will have the opporunity to sabotage each other by shooting at each other's outer layer of wall. Not exactly sure how this is gonna work, but we'll figure it out!

The more walls you have, the more likely you will be able to outlast your opponent against the mob of zombies! 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The round begins and both players see a 2D view of themselves, along with their opponent, standing in a random position on a field. Both players find themselves surrounded by a double layer of walls. A 3-second countdown appears 
on both players' screens, and as the countdown reaches 0, a random task pops up for both players. This could be a task where players have to shoot a moving object or maneuver their character around obstacles using WASD or anything of the sort. Once a task is completed, the player gains a layer of wall to protect themselves against the zombies. The countdown begins again and a new random task appears on the player's screen. More and more zombies spawn and attempt to break down the walls. The tasks are continuously generated until one player has outlasted the other.  

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The competiveness. Since player are competing to see who can outlast the zombies, players will likely feel hard-pressed not to give-up so as to be the one who claims the ultimate victory. Also, since tasks are random, players will be kept from getting bored easily.
