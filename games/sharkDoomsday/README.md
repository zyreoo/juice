# Shark Doomsday

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Minecraft but it's underwater and 2D (& pixelart), focused around a shark that had lost its kingdom.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The fun comes from exploring the whole underwater world and creating stuff, also to build a new shark kingdom.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players can collect materials such as sunken trash and buried treasure with the purpose to rebuild/build their very own shark empire, also being able to befriend other sharks or creatures. At the same time, the player has to fend off enemies. After that, the player can conquer the ocean temple and at last summon the Guardian of the Sea, bringing peace to the shark land. (simillar to the end in Minecraft)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The main plan is to have the world be free, like Minecraft, where players have control over what they can do (such as to explore, build, and create stuff)
