***How would you pitch your game in one line?***

A main character that fights monsters to prevent a apocalypse, with a bunch of levels

***what is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?***

Each level with different platform designs, forcing players to adapt. Difficulty-based enemies etc. And importantly game designs to be highly detailed

***how does the game actually play? (core game loop)***

- Navigate through platform challenges

- A story-based RPG with alot of details towards the design

***how will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? what's the general scope of your game (will change as you go?)***

As players journey through different levels, new enemies are introduced while previous ones remain relevant, adding progressive complexity. The general scope of the game is that it is going to consist of different landforms, but this is highly conceptual and don't know if it is going to turn out as hoped.
