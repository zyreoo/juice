**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Mortal Kombat meets Dragon Ball Fighter Z but with way lesser gore and the unique option to make our own characters and customize the abilities.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
There are plenty of mechanics like : Vanishing dodge, blocking, counter abilities, invincibility, finishing moves, and unique character voice lines and theme songs for every scene they make it to.

**How does the game actually play? **
This game is a fighter game in 2D graphics. In addition to the player's personal character, there other characters in the game that the game itself provides throughout the gameplay experience. 
The main part of the game are the challenge levels where there is a story mode and you can play against bots to hone your skills. The higher the level,
The harder the bots become to beat. Each challenge level is a piece to the original story. Completing levels will provide you with unique/common equipments, customization items, and experience points. 
The players will recieve emerald plated coins (the in game free to use currency) to buy the equipment or customization item they like. Unique skills are also part of the game and they can be selected from the 
character skill menu, where the skills of all the available characters and even more skills not unique to any character, yet no character has, will be available for the player to customize. The character's music and 
the voicelines can be customized to whatever the player chooses it to be (music has to be selected from the game).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The main plan for sustaining gameplay is to possibly add two player mode, where you can work with, or, contend against a friend. One step above that would be to introduce multiplayer to the game where players can 
match against opponents of their own skill level in solo ranked. Duo ranked can be added later as well.
