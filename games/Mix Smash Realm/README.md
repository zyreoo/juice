**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Mortal Kombat meets Dragon Ball Fighter Z but with way lesser gore and the ability to explore the map and play with different characters.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
There are plenty of mechanics like : Vanishing dodge, blocking, counter abilities, invincibility, finishing moves, and theme songs for every scene they make it to.

**How does the game actually play? **
This game is a fighter game in 2D graphics. In addition to the player's personal character, there other characters in the game that the game itself provides throughout the gameplay experience. 
The main part of the game are the challenge levels where there is a story mode and you can play against bots to hone your skills. The higher the level,
The harder the bots become to beat. Each challenge level is a piece to the original story. Completing levels will provide you with unique/common equipments, customization items, and experience points. 
The character's music and the voicelines can be customized to whatever the player chooses it to be (music has to be selected from the game).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
By adding many levels of varying difficulty and adding different characters and maps.
The main plan for sustaining gameplay is to possibly add two player mode, where you can work with, or, contend against a friend. One step above that would be to introduce multiplayer to the game where players can 
match against opponents of their own skill level in solo ranked. Duo ranked can be added later as well.
