## Split Horizon

Team Members: Zoya Hussain & John Tan-Aristy (@zsh and @john)

How would you pitch your game in one line? Itâ€™s like _Ilomilo_ meets _Enter the Gungeon_, but with worldwide quests and split-screen co-op gameplay that brings players together. 

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? 
- Split-screen co-op designed for two players to bond as they solve puzzles and complete quests
- Power-ups are unique, transferable, and require coordination between players
- Varied environments and puzzles inspired by major global cities

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop):  
- Players complete quests on a map, earning clues to bring their characters closer together, geographically and narratively
- Both characters contribute to solving a crisis that splits the world in half 
- Increasingly challenging gameplay, featuring location-based puzzles

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
- Game gets progressively difficult and puzzles vary keep the gameplay challenging
- Challenges and enemies that correspond to each location in order to make every level feel distinct
- Specific scope: 2D split-screen co-op adventure
