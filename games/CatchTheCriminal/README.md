# Game Name CatchTheCriminal

**Team Members:** Simone MARTON 

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A tv show inspired me to do this game, Dexter. "Always a policeman is the best criminal"

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
So it s simple, at every level is gonna be a criminal who is murdered by the same policeman, and you need to find who s the policeman who murdered the criminal:)), it s a story game:)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The last achievement is to find who is the policeman who murdered the criminal, but you need to find clues, and achieve camera recordings with the murder, or find feetprints and many things, you need to use ure smart thinking to find who is the policeman u look for. Also you work as a policeman

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
I will keep players engaged for 30 minutes with different levels, achievements, finding new clues which could go to finding the policeman, in game u don t know that the criminal who murdered the criminal is a policeman:)). This is my idea for juice. Thx for ur time and i hope u like it.
