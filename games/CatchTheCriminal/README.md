# Game Name CatchTheCriminal

**Team Members:** Simone MARTON 

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A tv show inspired me to do this game, Dexter. "Always a policeman is the best criminal"

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
you just need to find the criminal

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
is actually a thief and police game, where the criminal and runs and the policeman runs after it, now i don t work to graphics, i ve started with mechanics and some free sprites
**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
i will make some different levels, some interesting coins and with those you can buy things that could help you in the game
