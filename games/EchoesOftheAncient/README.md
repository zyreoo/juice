**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

"Unveil the dying whispers of an ancient civilization in a 20-minute sprint through crumbling temples, where every glyph and hieroglyph holds the key to survival—or eternal entombment."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

**Glyph-Based Puzzles**: Manipulate light, sound, and patterns to activate doors and mechanisms.
**Environmental Storytelling**: Discover hidden murals to piece together the civilization’s demise.
**Seamless Immersion**: No UI—symbols glow, sound waves ripple visibly, and temples collapse dynamically.

**How does the game actually play?** (Core Game Loop)

**Awaken & Learn**: The player wakes in a temple, interacting with a glowing symbol to open doors.
Solve & Advance**: Solve escalating puzzles (redirect light, harmonize sound, align patterns) to unlock new zones.
**Discover & Repeat**: Hunt secrets (optional murals, hidden rooms) to deepen the narrative, then escape before collapse.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as I go)?**

**Bite-Sized Tension**: 20-minute runtime encourages replays to perfect puzzles and uncover secrets.
**Dynamic Environments**: Temples crumble slightly differently each run, forcing adaptive solutions.
**Scope**: 5 handcrafted rooms, 3 core mechanics (light, sound, patterns), and 2 divergent puzzle solutions per room.
