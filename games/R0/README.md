# R0

**Team Members:** Sebastian Alexis, Esean Fang, Andy Zhang

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You are a virus who must infect the entire world in this dungeon crawler style game!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game plays off the idea of R0, which is the reproductive value of a disease (how many people 1 infected person can infect). Each level will unlock new gear and perks that can be used to upgrade your R0 value, get new attack types, and grow stronger.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Each time you play the game, you start as a different virus with different styles. Each level is a different level of infection. Starting in an animal, you must conquer and infect the entire animal to move on to a farm, to move onto a town, to a city, to a country, and then to the globe.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each level has new types of enemies, progressivley getting harder. The learning curve is incredibly low, and the end goal is simple. By keeping upgrades and unique perks, we keep the player engaged.
