# Obscura

**Team Members:** Yufan Wang, Hayoon Song

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A psychological horror game about reflections disguised in a atmospheric top-down puzzle-adventure format.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic of Obscura revolves around a dual-world system, where the player interacts with mirrors to reveal and manipulate the mirrored world. As they progress, the reflection becomes more unstable, leading to unique puzzles involving symmetry, desynchronization, and the merging of the two worlds.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game will be in a top-down format, controlled by WASD/E or arrow keys/space in movement/interact controls. Players navigate the world in a top-down perspective, solving environmental puzzles that involve interacting with mirrors (among other things, obviously). After the completion of a level / stage, the player will spawn at the beginning of the next stage. The playerâ€™s primary challenge is balancing puzzle-solving with the need to survive in an increasingly hostile environment.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
In the first three to four levels, players will be introduced to the core mechanics in a tutorial section of sorts: the dual-world puzzle system, controls, and the gradual revelation of the mirrored world. Soon after this mark, players will experience their first major shift, where the reflected world begins to desynchronize, giving them a taste of the psychological horror that will intensify in later levels. This will be divided into two sections: the atmospheric puzzle section and the post-merge section (more information on that later when it gets programmed). We expect the tutorial section to take around 8 minutes to complete, atmospheric puzzle section around another 15 minutes or so, and post-merge taking up the rest of the time.
