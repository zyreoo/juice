# Aether 

**Team Members:** Tathya Garg 

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a 2D roguelike game like Soul Knight, but it's actually 4D and not 2D (you can travel across the X, Y, Time, and Multiverse Dimensions). Inspired by the game "5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel".

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is the ability to travel across the X, Y, Time, and Multiverse Dimensions. This allows for a lot of interesting gameplay mechanics and puzzles.
For example, you can travel back in time to undo your mistakes, or you can travel to a different universe to get a different weapon. You can then transfer that weapon to your current universe and use it to defeat the enemies.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world taken over by aliens who discovered that humans had found a way to harness the power of the Aether.
The Aether is a powerful energy source that can be used to travel across the X, Y, Time, and Multiverse Dimensions.
The Aether was used on a single person, the protagonist, who is now the only hope for humanity.
The protagonist must travel across the dimensions to defeat the aliens and free the imprisoned humans.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will have a lot of different levels, each with different enemies and puzzles. The player will have to use the Aether to solve the puzzles and defeat the enemies.
The game will also have a lot of different weapons and abilities that the player can use to defeat the enemies.
Midway through the game, the aliens will learn how to use the Aether and will start using it against the player, splitting up the remaining prisoners.
