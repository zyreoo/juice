**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a 2d story-based adventure/puzzle game that uses unique control perspectives to tell a narrative.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The biggest unique mechanic is based on the lamp that gets various unique views and abilities throughout the game, letting you see more of the screen (which is entirely dark) as well as fight off various enemies and solve puzzles!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Most of the gameplay is centered on using the lamp to solve various puzzles and fight off enemies. You adventure through the deep caves, slowly unlocking new abilities, until you can fly out.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
As you go, you'll unlock new views and abilities for your lamp that you will need to switch between and balance as you go. This along with the various puzzles that can take some time to first figure out and then complete will keep the player engaged for 30 mins.
