# Line by Line / 一笔一线

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You play as a cat riding on buses around the city, drawing tiny doodles to give to the other passengers that you meet on these trips as you learn more about their backstories. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player will be given an image related to one of the passengers to doodle. We compare how similar it is to the actual drawing and accumulate points and give rewards based what they have draw. These accumulated points can then be used to gacha for items.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player starts the day in their house and chooses a bus line to take every day. On the bus, they doodle a passenger and can unlock more story/interaction with the passenger. After getting off the bus, they can visit the location and play a minigame to earn prizes. As the player progresses, their house fills up more and more with items that they’ve collected on their adventure.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players can accumulate more points towards a gacha mechanic to allow them to collect items that fill their house over time. 
They can also learn more about the main character as they interact with the other passengers around them. As players interact more with passengers, the “doodles” become harder to match and more complicated as a mechanic to increase game difficulty.
