**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like FNAF but with guns, servers, bugs and other nerdy stuff, you need to protect yourself against hackers trying to destroy your infrastructure.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The main task of the game is fighting against various random obstacles which antagonists - "Hackers" prepared for you like bugs, but you have to physically kill them, or you have to reconfigure your machines by compleating a rythm game, or reorganizing your whole cable menagement. On top of that it's friday afternoon and you have to return home before your wife kills you (literally).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game starts on friday afternoon, when you think you can go home, but suddenly hackers start to attack your lab. You will have to do several random tasks uder time preassure from your wife or you may not come alive out of this. As the game continues you will acquire helpful items, but the tasks will be harder.  

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game?**
The game starts easy but increments its difficulty over time. Randomized, time sensitive tasks make every gameplay slightly different and require player to engage. Funny cutscenes will make this game a bit more entertaining.
