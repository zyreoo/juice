# Cardfield

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
Think of Advance Wars but with card game elements. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
Its a basic turn-based stategy game but with the twist that you and your opponent have cards that can affect the playing field. The fun would come with the stategy and little bit of luck that the cards bring.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Every turn you would gain a certain amount of points that you could use to play cards and also draw a card, after this you would get to move your troops and attack the enemies, then it would go to the enemy which would be an AI. There would be a screen to make a deck before this. In order to win you would need to elimate all of your opponents troops.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
The plan is to have a round last a decent about of time. They would be engaged while making strategy. I want to have a decent amount of cards (~10), and atleast a single map to play on. I also want to make a enemy AI and maybe make multiple troop types.
