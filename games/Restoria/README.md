How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
By having puzzles and a story to go through so the player has to play for at least 30 minutes in order to play! :)

Other notes:
Trickle-down story structure. Metroidvania game. 
Plot: You’re a creature that awakens in a destroyed (ever-increasingly industrialized) forest (you had amnesia so you have 0 recollection of what happened before). A bird wakes you up thinking you are one of the fuzzy-ball pets and was thinking that you can be the bird’s pet, but then gets scared that you are so big when you un-rolled. You then go through a tutorial-like stage (but no real tutorial, you kind of figure out the game mechanics by yourself). 

- Your goal is to restore the forest (stop pollution + pick up trash) and save all of the birds, but there is an evil person attempting to control the birds because they have magical powers.
