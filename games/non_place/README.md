### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**

it's a cute 2D game where people get to make their own space cafe, flower shop, book
store, etc. - making their dream space come alive in the digital world, and as they
progress into the game and are done with one project, they can advance to level two where
they unlock a new floor or a new building to start a new project.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Side quests where players create their own products in order to gain points keeps the
game engaging. Other conversations/interactions with the NPCs will further make the
experience more fun.

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The players try customizing their digital space with furniture, and other features to make
their place truly theirs. In order to achieve that, they must gain coins/ power units which
they use to buy their stuff. These coins/ power units are attained by customizing an item
based on the place they chose (say, you picked your project to be a cafe, you must
make/customize a drink, or if it were a flower shop, making a bouquet would be the task).
Once they are done decorating their space, they unlock more space, this would be in the
form of another floor or another building up until the point they make their own street/ mini
town/ or a whole building entirely theirs.

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

The players will be engaged in the game for 30 minutes as they customize their place,
achieve side quests and find ways to gain coins.

Remember: Focus on gameplay mechanics and player experience. Save the details about
story, art style, sound design, Ul flowcharts, marketing plans, or achievements for later.
