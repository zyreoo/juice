**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a **2D fighting arcade game** like **Final Fight** but you are part of a Rock/Metal band and you fight rival band
followers and members using your guitar.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Fighting with your guitar.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You are trying to complete a series of festivals, at the start of every stage you are playing with your band (
instrumental) when one person trows something (a chair or a tomato) at you and the fighting game starts: you hit the "
enemy's" followers with your guitar and at the end of the stage you fight the boss (the other band).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
You will fight in a series of stages of a fastival or multiple festivals and will upgrade your tools with the money
taken at the end of the stage or event.
