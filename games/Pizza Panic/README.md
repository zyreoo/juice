# Pizza Panic

**Team Members:** [Rishabh]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
We have to make pizzas from ingrdients and then be the fastest to eat them.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The person gets to not only make a pizza with memory as it will be a memory game. But then be the fastest one to eat it hence bringing in a new fun challange. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
A image of pizza will be shown. The pizza would have random ingrdients. Then the image would dissapear and the person would have to make the pizza. After they did it correctly they will have to eat the pizza the fastest. They will tap the screen and they will have to tap it certain amount of time in a given amoount of timelimit to win the game. There would be levels and the game would be harder as the level progresses.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The higher the levels go the more the will have to momerize hence they will spend longer time thinking keeping them enganged in the game for a long period of time.
