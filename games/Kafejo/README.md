__How would you pitch your game in one line?__ 
Imagine Stardew Valley and Undertale, but you are the owner of a soon-to-be-best coffee shop.

__What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?__ 
At its core Kafejo (esperanto for coffee shop) is a tycoon game, where players continously upgrade their premises to get new customers and keep the old ones coming back, whether it be through better coffee, faster queues, or just more pleasant interior design. 

__How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)__
The player's main goal is to increase the rating of their coffee shop.
They can do this by upgrading their equipment, increasing the quality of their brews, keeping their customers happier etc.
Obviously, the players to pay rent and utilities, and if they don't, they lose the game.

__How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?__
Players may engage in various barista competitions, available as a minigame, which increase the prestige of their cafe.
At various points certain influential people may come in and leave their reviews. It is in the interest of the player to keep them as high possible.
There will be different side quests with engaging narratives, to allow for a break from the monotony of business management.
If the place is good enough, it may receive certain awards.
Also, there will be plenty of options to personalize the coffee shop and make it a truly atmospheric place!
