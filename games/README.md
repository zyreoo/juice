**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Breath of the Wild, Inside, and Monument Valley meet one another, but someone unplugged reality; now you're the tech support, solving elemental puzzles and a world in desperate need of color.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player travels through 5 biome-based glitch pockets within the greyscale world, solving logic-defying elemental puzzles and capturing cores to debug the world back into existence.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
A player can enter the monochromatic, corrupted zone with the purpose of restoring its color by solving absurd but element-themed challenges (like fixing an overheating volcano or rebooting a frozen desert) and collecting cores. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players dive into increasingly chaotic puzzles, including unexpected physics challenges and hunts for “core stones”. The world starts patching itself back together as you progress, becoming closer and closer to initial color-world flashbacks.
