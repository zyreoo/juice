# mountainVille

**Team Members:** Paolo & Thomas Stubblefield

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste meets Farmville but local tied-together co-op multiplayer

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You must jump from platform to platform with your teammate and make sure the string tieing you two together doesn't lead you to your doom. Initially the string feels like a constraint, but it becomes a resource allowing you to swing your teammate from platform to platform and pull the string in to climb up or extend it to let them climb down.

Each round you collect resources you need for your farm, seeds, creatures, etc that were displaced due to a torando. The resources you grow, make you better at hiking the trails (fulfilling your need for food/stamania)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players go through platformer series with their friend to collect the resources that they need to build their farm. They jump, climb, extend and de-extend their rope, etc. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will stage engaged by going through a series of trails (series of platformers levels) with escalating difficuluty. Each time it will feel more challenging than the last.

We'll have 4 mountains to climb (each mountain you climb will be for a different season). Weather conditions & materials you collect will get more intenses as the year progresses, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. 

At first you'll build your farm with the resources you get from your first mountain, then you'll find the animals that got lost along the way, and then you'll find villagers that were displaced on the Trail. You thought you found all of them on the third mountain (during Fall), but then wait oh no there are still a bunch to save during Winter (notably your family) (timed & critical you get them before they freeze & die).
