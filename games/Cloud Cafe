How would you pitch your game in one line? 
Customize your own cloud cafe by winning pastry-themed levels to fill up your space and unlock new items in this game that merges the Dinosaur Game with Animal Crossing. 

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? 
Customizable spaces, cute cloud graphics, and levels with increasing difficulty and include fun cafe food!!

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) 
Players are the cafe owners/designers and want to customize their cafe by winning levels. There is a base cafe setting with no customization. Players can click on items they wish to customize/change, and they will be taken to a minigame that they have to achieve a certain score or beat to be able to customize that item. As they play and beat more levels, their space is more customized.
The levels itself require the player to collect pastries while the screen is moving and putting obstacles in the way. Collecting a certain number of pastries without losing the level by running into something will allow the player to win that level and customize the item in the cafe itself.
Players enter the cafe on a cloud and transition to each minigame on a cloud.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? [Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]
There will be minigames that will take time by themselves, but the more they play, the more they can decorate their cafe, which will be a time-taking process. There will be several furniture to add and elements to accessorize the cafe with, each with a minigame, whether the same or not.
