**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like a survival game meets a factory sim but with different languages and fun characters

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
1. Puzzle-solving through visual communication: Players must decipher the creatures' rune-based demands through context clues, trial and error, and pattern recognition. This creates "eureka" moments when players crack the code.
2. Resource management and automation: Players build and optimize their factory to meet demands efficiently, similar to games like Factorio but with the added pressure of decoding what to build.
3. Risk/Reward timing: Players must balance taking time to understand demands vs. quickly producing something to prevent attacks, creating tension.
**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. Receive demand (shown through rune combinations)
2. Attempt to decode the demand through:
   - Visual hints (creatures pointing at things, showing examples)
   - Pattern recognition from previous demands
   - Contextual clues (urgency indicators, quantities shown)
3. Build/modify factory to meet interpreted demand
4. Submit products:
   - Correct: Gain resources/blueprints for expansion
   - Incorrect: Face consequences (angry creatures, lost resources)
5. Factory grows more complex as demands increase in sophistication
**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**
We will have a tutorial and multiple levels for the player to complete!
