**Team Members:** Gizzi

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia is inspired by indie games like lethal company and ultrakill, You must complete tasks, survive and also be quick

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The mechanics are similar to ultrakill and the unreleased "Karlson" while also promoting coop aspects like in lethal company.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

On a basic level: Scavenge and Prepare -> Engage and Survive -> Complete Objectives -> Repeat
Players will need to scavenge for their items while fighting enemies and finishing objectives to progress, and also needing to extract back with their items.
There will be dynamic events in the gameplay loop such as environmental changes, random mini bosses, and more.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Ultrakill's influence is key here, having gameplay be quick and flashy but also skillful makes it more engaging for the player.
The game being procedurally generated too at the same time will make for interesting and unique plays.
