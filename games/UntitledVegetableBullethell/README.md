# Untitled Vegetable Bullethell
> (i dont have name idea yet)

**Team Members:** Cyteon, T_Alex

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a isometric bullethell but the enemies are vegetables, which want to murder you.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is clearing out levels and killing enemies, its an important mechanic as well, its the way to progress further in the game.
It interacts with other mechanics like the store mechanic, as you get coins by killing enemies, and stores may appear after clearing levels.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The players traverse rooms/levels, fighting enemies in a storm of bullets. And they are well, trying to survive and beat the boss vegetable.
They will face challenges such as enemies that get progressively harder to defeat, and stronger taking more damage on you. There will also be smaller bosses you have to fight.
For each enemy killed/each level cleared you will get rewards such as coins, which you can use at some stores to buy new weapons and upgrades.
On some levels, you can access stores after clearing all the enemies.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
I will have multipile levels, upgrades, objectives, items, weapons, enemies etc. 
The general scope is killing enemies and clearing levels to progress, which will not change
