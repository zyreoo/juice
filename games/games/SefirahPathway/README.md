**Team Members:** Haven't found any

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
I want a normal world and a spirit world where you progress and get stuck in normal world you move to the spirit world to contiune moving.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
I want it a bit like minecraft where the overworld/normal world is safe and puzzle focused and if you move the the nether/spirit world where it's dangerous and combat-heavy.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
I think it would just repeat with increasing complexity with the futher the game progresses, the Spirit World becomes more aggressive, and the puzzles in the Normal World demand more reliance on Spirit World mechanics.
