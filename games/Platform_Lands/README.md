# Platform Lands

**Team Members:** Julia Nadolska

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a platformer where you wake up in an ancient temple and must restore a forgotten mechanism to uncover its secrets.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The core mechanic revolves around platforming and exploration within different biomes, where players must solve environmental puzzles and collect items to progress. The combination of jumping, wall-running, and dodging enemies creates a dynamic and engaging experience. The challenge lies in using the environment to your advantage while uncovering the secrets of the murky world.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players control a traveler who starts in an ancient temple and must venture into the jungle biome to collect specific items to restore a mechanism in the temple. The game is based on exploration, where players will jump, double-jump, wall-run, and navigate through challenging platforming sections. Along the way, they will encounter enemies and environmental puzzles that require creative solutions. The goal is to gather the items needed to progress and eventually unlock deeper parts of the temple.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, the game will feature multiple unique biomes, each with its own set of challenges. Players will explore these biomes, each offering distinct environmental puzzles, platforming sections, and enemies. The game will gradually introduce more complex challenges as players progress through different areas. Each biome will feel fresh and rewarding, offering new mechanics and opportunities for discovery. The core loop of exploration and puzzle-solving, combined with the need to gather items to progress, will keep players immersed and motivated to uncover the mysteries of the temple.
