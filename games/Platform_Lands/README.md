# Platform Lands

**Team Members:** Julia Nadolska

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
This is a platformer, but vertical, with different biomes (levels) and challenges.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player must complete various tasks that are tailored to the biome theme. After completing each task, the next vertical level is unlocked. Each level will have different extras (e.g. polar bears).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The core gameplay revolves around the player taking on the role of a researcher trapped within a mysterious simulation. The ultimate objective is to escape this simulated world, which requires unlocking all biomes and reaching the big gate located in the starting biome.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?

The player gradually unlocks new levels of the simulation by exploring diverse biomes, solving puzzles, and gathering resources needed to progress. Each unlocked biome introduces new challenges and pieces of the story, revealing the mysteries behind the simulation. Step by step, the player gets closer to escaping the simulation.
