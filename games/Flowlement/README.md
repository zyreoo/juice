# Flowlement

**Team Members:** @ag11901

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A psychedelic temple-exploration puzzle game where an acolyte harnesses crystal, void, and plasma forces while gliding across reality-bending planes, combining momentum-based movement with emergent element interactions in a striking low-poly visual style.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game centers on three interwoven systems that create emergent puzzle solutions:

Movement Mechanics:
Free-flowing momentum-based movement across geometric planes rendered in pseudo-3D. Players maintain complete directional control while building and managing speed, with the camera dynamically adjusting to showcase the path ahead. Movement feels weighty and precise, creating a satisfying flow state as you traverse the temple's impossible geometry.

Elemental Interactions:
Three cosmic forces that respond directly to player momentum and direction:
- Crystal formations sprout along your velocity vector, growing longer with higher speeds
- Void effects ripple outward based on movement intensity, creating geometric distortions
- Plasma trails follow your path, their intensity determined by speed

Puzzle Physics:
Rather than prescribed solutions, puzzles emerge from how these systems interact:
- Crystal can temporarily stabilize void-warped spaces
- Void fields create interference patterns that affect plasma flow
- Plasma circuits energize and modify crystal and void effects
- Movement speed and direction influence all element behaviors
- Multiple valid approaches based on player momentum and timing

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players explore temple chambers as an acolyte, each presenting spatial puzzles that require mastery of movement and elements:
1. Enter a chamber and analyze its geometric layout
2. Build momentum and collect elemental forces
3. Use speed and direction to create optimal element effects
4. Chain reactions between elements to forge new paths
5. Navigate the transformed space to reach the next area
6. Progress deeper into increasingly complex temple zones

Failed attempts reset chamber elements but maintain player knowledge of how their approach affected the space, encouraging experimentation with different speeds and element combinations.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**
The temple's progression spans four distinct zones, each evolving both mechanically and visually:

The Outer Courts:
- Teaches fundamental element behaviors
- Simple geometric layouts perfect for learning momentum control
- Clear visual feedback for element interactions
- 3 chambers focused on individual elements

The Gardens of Geometry:
- Introduces element combinations
- Curved paths requiring precise speed management
- Multiple interconnected planes
- 4 chambers exploring combined mechanics

The Reality Forge:
- Demands mastery of momentum-based element manipulation
- Complex geometric configurations
- Intense visual feedback from element interactions
- 4 chambers with challenging spatial puzzles

The Inner Sanctum:
- Tests complete understanding of all systems
- Recursive spaces that fold through themselves
- Most complex element combinations
- 3 chambers presenting ultimate challenges
