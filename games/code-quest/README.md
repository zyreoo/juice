**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A platformer where instead of controling the character you write code for it to follow

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You start out with no knowledge of the code or mechanics. As you play, you learn more keywords and can complete more complex levels
The keywords will be symbols or random letters (could be randomized each run to gate code behind a milestone)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You write some code, run it, the robot goes step by step executing the code.
You will most likely not get it (robot falls into spikes, doesn;t jump high enough)
You tweak your code, getting better each time until you complete the level

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
We will have many commands to use (forward, jump, turn, if, loop) and lots of fun levels to play
