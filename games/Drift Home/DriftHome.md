# Game Name: Drift Home 

**Team Members:** Aayan, Shayaan, Ruby

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like Journey meets Bad Piggies, but you're a lost balloon navigating the world through wind currents, physics puzzles, and perilous obstacles to return home.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- Realistic Balloon Physics:
    - The balloon is light and responsive, moving with wind currents, air vents, and subtle player control.
    - Players must manage buoyancy by releasing or inhaling air to rise or sink strategically.
- Wind & Environment-Based Puzzles:
    - Players must redirect airflows, use fans, bounce off soft surfaces, and avoid spikes or electrical hazards.
    - Some puzzles require momentum-based physics—riding gusts of wind at just the right time.
- Fragility & Strategy:
    - The balloon is delicate—sharp objects, strong winds, or overheating can pop it.
    - Players must think carefully and use soft landings, safe zones, and protective barriers.
-  Hidden Collectibles & Routes:
    -  Some areas have hidden air pockets or strings left behind by its owner—finding them gives bonus progression or unlocks shortcuts.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. The Balloon Awakens 
     - The game starts with a balloon floating away from a crying child in a park.
     - A sudden gust carries it far away, into unknown lands.
2. Navigating the World 
     - Players tap/hold controls to adjust altitude and ride the wind.
     - They steer using natural forces—drifting, bouncing, and gently gliding past obstacles.
     - Air Vents, Fans, Tornadoes, and Moving Platforms add complexity to movement.
3. Avoiding Dangers 
   - Spikes, fire, electrical wires, birds, and strong winds can pop the balloon.
   - Players time their movements, manipulate wind currents, or use objects to shield the balloon.
4. Solving Puzzles
    - Some levels introduce physics-based puzzles (e.g., opening a gate by inflating a weight-sensitive switch).
    - Players may need to use objects like cloths or boxes to block dangerous currents.
5. Progress & Emotional Payoff 
    - As the balloon gets closer to home, the environment changes (e.g., from stormy skies to calmer suburbs).
    - The final levels show glimpses of the owner searching for the balloon, leading to a heartfelt reunion.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- Smooth Difficulty Progression:
    - The first levels are relaxing, allowing players to enjoy the physics.
    - Later levels introduce more obstacles, moving air currents, and precise navigation challenges.
- Exploration & Secrets:
    - Players can take multiple routes, discovering hidden wind tunnels and secret collectibles.
    - Optional challenges encourage risk vs. reward gameplay (e.g., a hidden shortcut through a dangerous cave).
- Emotional Narrative Without Words:
    - Players see small visual cues of the child looking for the balloon, adding emotional weight to the journey.
    - The ending is bittersweet yet satisfying, bringing the balloon home safely.
- Replayability:
    - Time Trials Mode: Beat levels faster by mastering wind physics.
    - Endless Drift Mode: A Zen-like survival mode where players float endlessly through randomized air currents.
