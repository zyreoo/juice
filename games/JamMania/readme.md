# Jam Mania

**Team Members:** Kasen Engel

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A rhythm game where you press keys to match poses!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The poses/keys can change dynamically through the song, causing the player to constantly change how they play.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
It's a rhythm game. The win condition is beating the songs, the lose condition is running out of life. You can press keys and you can choose more difficult maps if you feel more confident in your abilities.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Keep them engaged with a good variety of music (I'm gonna reach out to producers, yay!) and have a wide variety of fun things to use. I'll also attempt to add items for your player character to add your own flair.
Finally, i want to have a paper art style, not unlike something like Paper Mario, with plenty of sound effects, fast ui to get into the game, and plenty of acievements to give someone something to work for.
