# Hot Sauce Adventure

**Team Members:** Thomas Huertas del Pino, Ephram Grant, Clement Susanto, Matthew Martin

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste but with an ability progression system reminiscent of metroidvania titles such as Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Players will be able to acquire multiple abilities as they progress through levels to add to the movement options available such as double jumps, bashes, and spike pogoing. These mechanics when combined will allow the player a multitude of options to tackle the challenges of each individual level. Levels will also contain environmental features that will add to the movement options of the player such as moving obstacles and jump pads that will further add to the complexity of the movement.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players enter one of many uniquely designed levels containing environmental hazards such as spikes and pits and have to use and combine multiple unique movement techniques to traverse through the level to reach the final goal of a hot sauce bottle at the end. Throughout the level, players will be forced to use dashes, double jumps, and unique environmental features to progress through screens to reach the end. As they play through levels, players may find secret obstacles and challenges that will serve to raise their score. At the end of each level, players will receive a score based on both the amount of time it took to complete the level and how many secret challenges they completed.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be engaged through the unique and precise movement system that they will use to traverse unique and varied hazards and obstacles to ultimately complete multiple, distinct levels with the highest score possible. These scores will provide a means of comparison by which players will be motivated to improve and beat previous scores causing them to continue to play for over 30 minutes.
